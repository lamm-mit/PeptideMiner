Although numerous self-assembled chiral \nmaterials have been designed, the precise control of their twisting tendency and \ntheir handedness is still a challenge. Herein, we report the self-assembly of \nchiral nanostructures with precisely tailored architectures by changing the \namino acid sequences of the peptides. We designed a series of self-assembling \ntripeptides bearing different l-amino acid sequences. The peptide with \nl-Phe-l-Phe sequence preferred to self-assemble into left-handed nanohelices, \nwhile with l-Phe-l-Trp right-handed nanohelices would be formed. Moreover, the \ndiameter of the self-assembled nanohelices could be tailored by changing the \nterminal amino acids (His, Arg, Ser, Glu, and Asp). Circular dichroism (CD) and \nmolecular dynamics simulations (MDSs) revealed that both of the right- and \nleft-handed nanohelices formed by the tripeptides showed negative Cotton effects \nin the peptide adsorption region but exhibited nearly opposite CD Cotton effects \nin the aromatic regions. These results indicated that the handedness of the \nself-assembled helical nanofibers was not only determined by the chirality of \nthe peptide backbone but also closely related to the aromatic stacking, hydrogen \nbonding and steric interactions induced by the side chains. The findings deepen \nour understanding on the chiral self-assembly of peptide and offer opportunities \nfor the creation of highly functional chiral nanomaterials.\n\nPreparation of Fmoc-tripeptide Chiral Nanostructures. In a\ntypical experiment, the lyophilized Fmoc-FWH powder (2 mmol, 1.42\nmg) was dissolved in an aqueous solution (950 \u03bcL) under stirring at\nroom temperature through the addition of an appropriate amount of\n0.5 M NaOH (50 \u03bcL). Then, 0.1 M HCl was added to the mixture\nsolutions and adjusted to pH 6. Afterward, an appropriate amount of\nddH2O was added to the solutions to a \ufb01nal concentration of 2 mM.\nThe samples were then incubated at 25 \u00b0C for 24 h without any\ndisturbance. For the other Fmoc-tripeptide, the peptide assemblies\nwere obtained following the similar preparation procedure of Fmoc-\nFWH as described above. However, because the Fmoc-FWR and\nFmoc-FFR did not dissolve in H2O by adding HCl and NaOH, we\ninvestigated the self-assembly of Fmoc-FWR and Fmoc-FFR in a 5:95\n(v/v) methanol/H2O mixture. The peptides were \ufb01rst dissolved in\nmethanol at a concentration of 100 mM, which was then diluted in\n950 \u03bcL phosphate bu\ufb00er at pH 6.\nScanning Electron Microscopy. The morphologies and\nstructures of the Fmoc-tripeptide assemblies were investigated using\nscanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800, Japan) at an\nacceleration voltage of 3 or 5 kV. To prepare the samples, the Fmoc-\ntripeptide assemblies were spun on glass plates to dry and sputter-\ncoated with platinum using an E1045 Pt-coater (Hitachi High-\ntechnologies Co., Japan).\nTransmission Electron Microscopy. The samples for the TEM\nanalysis were prepared as follows: the assemblies were dispersed into\nddH2O and then 10 \u03bcL aliquots of the dispersion were spread onto a\n300-mesh carbon-coated copper grid. After air-drying, the samples\nwere negatively stained with 1 wt % phosphotungstic acid solution for\nFourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. Fourier transform\ninfrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was recorded on a Nicolet-560 FTIR\nspectrometer (Nicolet Co., U.S.A.) across the range of 400\u22124000\ncm\u22121 at room temperature. The peptides were dissolved in D2O to\neliminate the interference of H2O. The samples were adjusted to pD\nvalue to 6 with diluted NaOH and HCl in D2O.\npH Titration. Fmoc-FWH and Fmoc-FFH peptides were dissolved\nin ddH2O by adding 0.5 M NaOH at a concentration of 0.5, 2, 5, or\n10 mmol L\u22121 at pH \u2248 12. The titration curves were measured by\nmonitoring the pH values during the stepwise addition of 0.1 M HCl.\nThe tripeptides samples were stirred during the titration process.\nZeta Potential Measurement. Zeta potential measurements of\nthese Fmoc-tripeptide assemblies were investigated using a Zetasizer\nNano-ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd., U.K.). The samples of the\nassemblies were synthesized as mentioned before at pH 6.\nMolecular Dynamics Simulation. Molecular dynamics simu-\nlations (MDSs) were performed using the Gromacs program67,68 and\nthe Amber99SB-ILDN force \ufb01eld.69 Initial molecular structures of\nFmoc-FFH and Fmoc-FWH were constructed using Accelrys\nMaterials Studio 2.5 software. The tLeaP tool was used to add the\nhydrogen atom of the Fmoc-tripeptide residue. Models was centered\nin an orthorhombic periodic boundary condition (PBC) box with a\nmargin of 1 nm and \ufb01lled with SPCE water molecules.70 Na+ and Cl\u2212\nions were added to make the system electrically neutral. The system\nwas performed with 5000 steepest descent steps and 5000 conjugate\ngradient minimization steps to achieve energy minimization and then\nsimulated for 40 ns at a time step of 1 fs in the NPT ensemble at a\ntemperature of 300 K. Nonbonded and long-range electrostatic\ninteractions were calculated using the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME)\nmethod71 with a cuto\ufb00 value of 1.0 nm.

To induce gelation, a trigger is normally applied\nto induce a sol-to-gel transition. Commonly, temperature,3 pH4 or\nsolvent composition5 are used to induce gelation.\nWe have been examining suitably functionalised dipeptides as\npotential hydrogelators. These include dipeptides functionalised\nat the N-terminus with aromatic groups such as naphthalene4b,6\nor \ufb02uorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc).4a,7 We and others have\nshown that such molecules can form gels when a DMSO\nsolution of the gelator is diluted with water2,4a,5,8 or when\nthe pH of a dipeptide solution is decreased from high pH,\nthrough the apparent pKa of the C-terminus.6 During this\nwork, we routinely utilise dipeptide concentrations of 0.5 wt%.\nWe recently demonstrated that this concentration is above the\ncritical micelle concentration (cmc) of some of the dipeptides\nexamined at high pH.6b At this high pH, solutions of many of\nthe dipeptides examined are free-\ufb02owing liquids with the\napparent viscosity of water at the same pH. However, other\ndipeptide solutions were signi\ufb01cantly viscous at high pH. We\nhypothesised that this was the result of aggregation of the\ndipeptides at high pH into worm-like micelles, presumably\nwith a hydrophobic core consisting of the naphthalene and\nhydrophobic amino acids, stabilised by the carboxylates\n(Fig. 1a). Assuming such a morphology, we rationalised that\ncross-linking with divalent cations should lead to gelation for\nthis sub-class of functionalised dipeptide (Fig. 1b), similar to\nthat observed for biopolymers such as pectin and alginate, for\nwhich an egg-box based model has been proposed.9 Here, we\ndemonstrate that this is the case and it is therefore possible to\nprepare gels over a wide range of pH using a small number of\ngelators. This greatly expands the utility of these gelators.\nHere, we discuss a subset of naphthalene-functionalised\ndipeptides (1\u20135, Scheme 1).

Cryo-TEM of solutions of 4 at high pH demonstrated\nthat this dipeptide forms spherical aggregates under these\nconditions (Fig. S2, ESI;w conventional TEM with stain shows\nno aggregates at high pH6a). However, at the same pH and\nconcentration, solutions of the naphthalene-diphenylalanines\n1\u20133 are noticeably viscous, with viscosities of 33, 122 and\n56 mPa s respectively at 1 s(cid:2)1 (Fig. S1, ESIw). All solutions\nexhibit signi\ufb01cant shear thinning,\nindicative of alignment of\naggregates under the \ufb02ow when the deformation is faster than\nthe time required to re-form the equilibrium network structure.\nSimilarly, small-angle X-ray scattering experiments demonstrate\nstrong orientation under shear, showing the presence of highly\nanisotropic species (Fig. 1c\u2013e). The presence of long, worm-like\nmicelles was further con\ufb01rmed by TEM (Fig. 1f).\nAt an initial pH of 11.7, addition of a number of salts as\nsolids to a solution of 1 generated self-supporting hydrogels.\nMore homogeneous gels could be prepared via the addition of\nsmall amounts of concentrated solutions of salts to a solution\nof 1 at high pH (Table 1). Gel formation presumably occurs\nvia the formation of salt bridges between carboxylates on\ndi\ufb00erent worm-like micelles, forming cross-links and hence a\nthree-dimensional network. TEM shows similar structures to\nthose seen before salt addition (Fig. 1g). Visually, there\nappears to be similar dispersity in \ufb01lament widths and lateral\nassociations between pH-triggered10 and salt-triggered assembly.\nThe use of divalent cations resulted in gels with higher moduli\nthan monovalent cations (Fig. S4, ESIw) and for divalent ions,\nG0 was almost one order of magnitude greater than G0 0.\nTable 1 Rheological properties for gels formed on addition of salt\nsolutions (\ufb01nal concentration of 0.05 M) to a solution of 1\nThe e\ufb00ect of salts on gelators has been documented for a\nnumber of cases, but is extremely complex.11 Kuang et al. have\nrecently reported an Fmoc-pentapeptide that is sensitive to\npotassium over sodium ions.12 In their case, the peptide\nsequence was derived from a K+-binding epitope. Here,\nsimilar G0 were obtained with sodium and potassium salts.\nFrom the perspective of applications such as cell culturing, the\nuse of bu\ufb00ers is common and hence the e\ufb00ect of salts on\ngelators such as 1 is an important observation. In some cases, we\nnote that the \ufb01nal pH was a\ufb00ected by the addition of the salt.\nWithin the chloride salts, G0 correlated with the Hofmeister\nseries, with Ca2+ leading to the gel with the highest G0, followed\nby Mg2+, Na+, Li+, K+ and NH4\n+. For the Ca2+ salts, G0\ndecreased in the order of nitrate, chloride to sulfate as would\nalso be expected from the Hofmeister series. Focusing on\ncalcium nitrate, addition at pH 11.7 to solutions of 1 or 2\nled to the formation of invertable hydrogels over a period of\napproximately 90 min. For solutions of 3, a gel-like phase\nco-existed in the presence of some liquid. In contrast, for 4 a\nhomogeneous clear liquid resulted and for 5, a precipitate\nformed. This clearly demonstrates the importance of the\nmicellar structure at high pH. For 1, G0 was controlled by\nthe concentration of calcium nitrate used (Fig. 2). G0 reached a\nmaximum at a ratio of calcium: carboxylic acid of approxi-\nmately 2 : 1. For 1, G0 exceeded G0 0 across a wide range of\ncalcium nitrate concentrations, with tan d being between 0.10\nand 0.19 from 1.0 mg mL(cid:2)1 to 60 mg mL(cid:2)1 (Fig. S5, ESIw),\nsimilar to values obtained for pH-triggered or solvent-triggered\nhydrogels.7,8 The addition of calcium salts has also previously\nbeen used to induce gelation using a number of peptide-\namphiphiles.4c,13 However, in these cases, the peptides carry\nmultiple carboxylic acids rather than the single C-terminus\npresent in the current case.\nGels were formed on addition of calcium nitrate from a\npH of 12 to a pH of 7. The apparent pKa of 1 is 6.0 (Fig. S6,\nESI) and, as described elsewhere,6b for pH-driven gelation this\nis the pH around which gelation starts to occur. In the presence\nof calcium nitrate, there was a gradual decrease in G0 with\ndecreasing pH until the apparent pKa (Fig. S7, ESIw). This is to\nbe expected. The cross-links between worm-like micelles require\nthe presence of both salts and deprotonated carboxylates. As\nthe pH decreases, the proportion of carboxylates will decrease\nand hence the number of cross-links will be lower. The presence\n12072Chem.Commun.,2011,47,12071\u201312073ThisjournaliscTheRoyalSocietyofChemistry2011Published on 17 October 2011. Downloaded by MIT Library on 3/21/2024 2:19:20 PM. View Article Online\fgel with a signi\ufb01cant pH gradient within the system. Over 24 h,\nequilibration occurred such that the entire system was at a\nuniform pH of 3.8, very close to the 3.7 expected.\nFinally, we note that whilst gels are only formed at\nhigh pH on salt addition for dipeptide solutions that exhibit\nshear-thinning, the examples are not restricted to 1\u20133. Fmoc-\ndiphenylalanine (which form gels on pH decrease from high pH4a)\nalso exhibits shear-thinning behavior at high pH and indeed forms\na gel on addition of calcium nitrate (G0 = 10.5 kPa).\nIn conclusion, we have shown that a subset of dipeptide-\nbased hydrogelators can form sti\ufb00, self-supporting hydrogels\nat high pH on addition of salts. There are analogies here with\npectin-based gels, where gelation can be induced by Ca2+ or\nby acid depending on the molecular weight of the pectin, as\nwell as with the peptide-amphiphiles developed by Stupp.4c,13\nGels can now be prepared from dipeptide-gelators across the\nwhole pH range either by acid or salt addition. This expands\nthe range of dipeptide-based gelators that can be used at\nphysiological pH.\n2 (a) D. J. Adams, Macromol. Biosci., 2011, 11, 160; (b) D. J. Adams\nand P. D.

Gels contain Universal Indicator. Over time, the\npH equilibrates.\nof calcium nitrate below the apparent pKa resulted in a slightly\nincreased G0 if included prior to a decrease in pH; adding\ncalcium nitrate after pH adjustment resulted in G0 being very\nsimilar to that in the absence of added salt (Fig. S8, ESIw).\nA transition between the salt-induced and pH-induced gels\nwas possible. To exemplify this, glucono-d-lactone (GdL) was\nadded as a solid to the top of a gel formed via the addition of\nsodium nitrate to a solution of 1 (a monovalent salt was\nchosen for experimental ease as the initial gel is therefore\nweak and the e\ufb00ect of acid easy to observe). We have\npreviously used GdL to induce a slow, uniform pH drop as\ndissolution of GdL is signi\ufb01cantly quicker than hydrolysis to\ngluconic acid.6,7a,b After addition of sodium nitrate, a gel with\na G0 of 340 Pa was formed after 40 min (Fig. 3). Su\ufb03cient\nGdL was then added to the top of the gel to result in a \ufb01nal\npH of 3.4. This caused the pH to initially drop quickly (see Fig. 3\ninsert). G0 dropped quickly to 90 Pa and then started to rise\ndramatically. This correlated with the gel strength dropping as\nthe pH dropped to the apparent pKa and then, on reaching\nthe pKa, starting to increase as pH induced gelation started.\nGel-to-gel transitions are very rare.14 Based on the rheological\ndata, it currently seems more likely that this is a gel-to-sol-to-\ngel transition, but absolute determination is di\ufb03cult from the\ncurrent data and is the subject of continuing work.\nThis approach can be used to prepare interesting single-\ngelator systems with dramatic pH gradients. To exemplify this,\na gel was prepared from 1 at a \ufb01nal pH of 3.4 using GdL. After\ngel formation, a solution of 1 at pH 11.7 was placed on top of\nthe \ufb01rst gel and gelation induced by addition of a solution of\ncalcium nitrate.

In the case of FF alone, an elegant study revealed\ndiscrete nanotubes of persistent length, when a concentrated\nsolution of the dipeptide in hexa\ufb02uoroisopropanol is diluted\nin water.3 Later, a few examples were reported of capped\nF derivatives, including di- and tripeptides, capable of self-assembly\nwhen \ufb01rst dissolved at high concentration in an organic solvent.4\nThis is not surprising as it is known that the self-assembly process is\nstrongly dependent on solvent.5 Di\ufb00erent is the case for Fmoc-FF\nand naphthalene-FF, that do not require the presence of organic\nsolvents to hydrogelate, but where self-assembly is driven by the\nsynthetic aromatic moiety.6\nHere, we report that while the short tripeptides VFF and FFV\nindeed do not self-assemble into \ufb01brils in phosphate bu\ufb00er, it is\nsu\ufb03cient to change the con\ufb01guration from L to D of the N-terminal\namino acid in both sequences to obtain self-supporting hydrogels.\nTo the best of our knowledge, these are the \ufb01rst examples of\nuncapped FF-containing tripeptides capable of self-assembly into\nhydrogels at physiological pH without the aid of organic solvents.\nInterestingly, Cryo-TEM and AFM data show that the change of\nFig. 1 Dynamic time sweep rheological data of freshly made hydrogels\n(left).

While\nboth gels were initially very soft (G0 of 10 kPa was reached only\nafter 1 hour for both peptides), it is worth noting that gelation of\nDFFV could be markedly accelerated by sonication (see ESIw).\nCryoTEM (Fig. 2) of the tripeptides containing a D-amino acid\nshowed nanoscale \ufb01brous morphologies, whilst no structures\ncould be identi\ufb01ed for their L-analogues. Interestingly, the resulting\nnanostructures of the two non-natural peptides were markedly\ndi\ufb00erent from each other. DVFF yielded long nanotapes, often\nrunning in parallel (Fig. 2A, white arrowheads) and displaying\nlateral stacking into wider structures (Fig. 2A, black arrowheads).\nDFFV self-assembled into thicker \ufb01laments, usually running in\ntwisted pairs with a recurrent helix period of B150\u2013200 nm\n(Fig. 2B and C). These nanostructures were con\ufb01rmed by\nAFM on dried gel samples (Fig. 3A\u2013D).

Occasionally, multiple DFFV\n\ufb01laments could also twist into coiled \ufb01brils (see ESIw). In further\nexperiments, the precursor solutions were dried onto a silicon wafer\nbefore gelation without sonication, in an attempt to gain insights\ninto the initial phases of self-assembly.

It is plausible\nthat this is due to the formation of aggregates for the two\nL-peptides, as their limited solubility led to slow precipitation.\nIt is worth noting that in the case of the self-assembling\npeptide DFFV, the intensity of the maximum was signi\ufb01cantly\nreduced, due to the presence of the D-aromatic amino acid.\nMore importantly, as expected only the two self-assembling\nstructures containing non-natural amino acids displayed the\nb-sheet minimum in the region 210\u2013220 nm (Fig. 5, bottom).\nThe DFFV self-assembled peptide was the only one showing a\nbroad positive signal in the near-UV region (250\u2013270 nm),\nwhich can be attributed to phenylalanine residues with tertiary\nstructure.

N-(t-butoxycarbonyl)-L-Phe-L-Phe-COOH (Boc-FF, Bachem)\nstock solutions were prepared in absolute ethanol and then diluted in the required\nratios in double distilled water, forming an array of peptide concentrations and\nsolvent compositions. The structural morphologies of the resulting species were\nthen determined by bright \ufb01eld microscopy and SEM observations. In all following\nexperiments, Boc-FF stock solution in ethanol was diluted to form 10% (v/v)\nethanol in water solution and phase behaviour was monitored by the following\nIsolation of different phases. Suspensions of Boc-FF spheres were prepared by\nmixing of 1 part in 10 by volume stock solution of its monomers into ddH2O\nfollowed by gentle mixing. The tubular phase was isolated by the vigorous agitation\nof this suspension or by allowing this solution to stand for 1 h. The \ufb01brillar phase\nwas isolated by centrifugation of suspensions of spheres at 4 (cid:2)C and the separation\nof the supernatant. The supernatant was stored at 4 (cid:2)C for 15\u201320 min and was then\n\ufb02ash frozen with liquid nitrogen and dried under reduced pressure.\nultraviolet\u2013visible spectroscopy. Ten-millilitre aliquots of a suspension of Boc-\nFF were prepared as described above and allowed to stand in a syringe. At 2-min\nintervals, the suspension was gently agitated and 1.5 ml was pushed through a\n0.22 mm syringe \ufb01lter (Millex Ultrapore, PVDF membrane). The concentration of\nBoc-FF in these aliquots was determined from the difference in speci\ufb01c absorbance\nat 257.6 nm and a baseline at 300 nm using Cary-Varian 400 spectrophotometer\nrunning WinUV software. The spectral bandwidth was 1.0 nm.\nDynamic light scattering. One millilitre suspensions of Boc-FF were prepared as\ndescribed above, and 100 ml aliquots were introduced into a low volume DLS cell.\nThe refractive index was estimated to be 1.450 and the absorbance to be 0.001. The\ndispersant viscosity was taken to be 1.538 cP, and the dispersant refractive index as\n1.339. Size measurements were made at 20 (cid:2)C using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZSP\n(Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). z-potential measurements were performed in\na Malvern disposable folded capillary cell the same parameters as above and with\nthe additional speci\ufb01cation of a dispersant dielectric constant at Er \u00bc 69.4. Mea-\nsurements were averaged over the \ufb01rst 5 min after sample preparation.\nconstant temperature of 10\u201320 (cid:2)C. The reference cell was \ufb01lled with 10% by volume\nof an ethanol solution in water, and the sample cell was \ufb01lled with a sample of\nBoc-FF spheres, prepared immediately prior to its introduction into the instrument\nby adding 10% by volume of a 7.5 g l (cid:2) 1 Boc-FF stock solution in ethanol into\nwater. For experiments conducted below room temperature, the water was pre-\ncooled and the DSC instrument was pre-set to a temperature of 4 (cid:2)C below that at\nwhich the experiment was to be performed, to minimize the time between sample\nintroduction and the beginning of each measurement. Baseline measurements were\nsubtracted from the reaction measurement, and the area of the exothermic peak\nintegrated to yield the enthalpy of transition.\nMicrodroplet formation. Micro\ufb02uidic channels were fabricated in poly-\ndimethylsiloxane (Dow Corning, Midland, MI, USA) using SU8 on silicon masters\nand standard soft lithography techniques, and then plasma bonded to glass slides to\ncreate sealed devices. Boc-FF stock solutions in ethanol were mixed on chip to form\na solution of 10% (v/v) ethanol in water, and microdroplets were formed in an oil\nphase of Fluorinert FC-40 (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK) and 2.0% (ww) block-\ncopolymer surfactant. Syringe pumps (Cetoni GmbH, Korbussen, Germany) were\nused to control the \ufb02ow of \ufb02uids, and the microdroplets were immediately inserted\ninto rectangular glass capillaries (CM Scienti\ufb01c, Silsden, UK) sealed and then\nobserved under bright \ufb01eld microscopy as a function of time.\nHigh-resolution scanning electron microscopy. Samples of Boc-FF solutions at\n1:10 ethanol/water ratios at various time points after the initiation of self-assembly\nwere placed on glass slides and were left to dry at room temperature. Samples were\nthen coated with Cr and viewed using a JSM-6700 \ufb01eld-emission HR-SEM (Jeol,\nTokyo, Japan), equipped with a cold \ufb01eld emission gun, operating at 1 kV.\nNuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. NMR data were acquired using a\nBRUKER Avance 700 Ultrashield spectrometer equipped with TXI Cryoprobe.\nSamples of the Boc-FF peptide were dissolved in 100% EtOD and then diluted to\nform solutions of 10% (v/v) ethanol in H2O. One-dimensional 1H spectra were\nrapidly acquired at 25 (cid:2)C using 180 water-selective pulses to suppress resonances\nfrom H2O. NMR data were processed and analyzed using TOPSPIN.\nX-ray powder diffraction. Samples of the spheres, gels and tubes were prepared as\nabove and mechanically ground into \ufb01ne powders. The resulting samples were\nplaced in a \ufb02at glass sample holder and XRPD data was collected on a laboratory\nPhilips X\u2019Pert Pro diffractometer using Bragg-Brentano geometry. X-rays were\ngenerated using Ni-\ufb01ltered Cu Ka1 radiation (l \u00bc 1.54056 \u00c5) generated at 40 kV\nand 40 mA at 298 K and a scan range of 3\u201360(cid:2) 2y and a step size of 0.033(cid:2) 2y.\nContinuous scans were done using the gonio scan axis, and data were analyzed\nusing X\u2019Pert HighScore Plus. The nano-scale ultrastructure of the spheres, \ufb01brils\nand tubes was retained in the \ufb01ne powders as con\ufb01rmed by electron microscopy."}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "polypeptide self-assembly literature information extraction"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Formation of fibril-type nanostructures of the Alzheimer's beta-amyloid \ndiphenylalanine (l-Phe-l-Phe, FF) at the organic-aqueous interface and the \nfactors affecting their structures have been investigated. Such nanostructures \nare also formed by bovine serum albumin and bovine pancreas insulin. The \nconcentration of the precursor taken in the aqueous layer plays an important \nrole in determining the morphology of the nanostructures. The addition of \ncurcumin to the organic layer changes the structure of the self-assembled \none-dimensional aggregates of diphenylalanine. By coating the diphenylalanine \ndipeptide fibrils with appropriate precursors followed by calcination in air, it \nhas been possible to obtain one-dimensional nanostructures of inorganic \nmaterials.\n\nDiphenylalanine1D\ufb01brilswerepreparedattheorganic-aqueous\ninterface as follows. A total of 10 mg of diphenylalanine\n(phenylalanine-phenylalanine, NH2-L-Phe-L-Phe-COOH; Bachem,\nSwitzerland) was dissolved in 2 mL of water at 50 \u00b0C in a 5 mL\nbeaker under sonication, and 2 mL of toluene was added to\nform an organic layer above the water layer. After 10 min, a\nthin white \ufb01lm formed at the interface. The \ufb01lm was lifted onto\na Si(111) or quartz substrate for characterization. To obtain\nlonger and more dense 1D nanostructures of diphenylalanine,\naggregation processes were continued for longer durations (30,\n50, 80, and 150 min), keeping the other conditions the same.\nFilms were also prepared without sonication of the water layer\nbefore the addition of toluene. The effect of the concentration\nof the precursor dipeptide in the water layer was examined by\ndecreasing its concentration to 0.5 mg/mL, keeping the other\nreaction parameters the same. The effect of curcumin on the\nformation of 1D \ufb01brils was examined by adding 2 mL of a 10-6\nM solution of curcumin in toluene, keeping the other parameters\nthe same. Considering the volume of the organic layer (2 mL),\nthe concentration works out to be 10-6 M, while the dipeptide\nconcentration is 0.016 M in the water layer (2 mL).\nA total of 10 mg of bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich,\nIndia) was dissolved in 2 mL of water in a 5 mL beaker, and 2\nmL of toluene was added on the top of the water layer. After\n20 h, a thin \ufb01lm formed at the interface. The \ufb01lm was lifted onto\nSi(111) for characterization. The concentration of bovine albu-\nmin in the water layer was decreased to 1 mg/mL, keeping the\nother parameters the same to examine the effect of dilution on\nthe structures at the interface. A total of 10 mg of bovine\npancreas insulin (Sigma-Aldrich, India) was dissolved in 2 mL\nof an aqueous acidic solution (pH ) 2), and 2 mL of toluene\nwas added on top of the water layer in a sealed beaker, which\nwas kept at 40 \u00b0C. After 3 days, a thin \ufb01lm formed at the\ninterface.\nIn order to examine the formation of 1D nanostructures of\ngold by using diphenylalanine \ufb01brils as templates, 2 mg of a\ndiphenylalanine 1D nanostructure as a dried powder was\ntreated with HAuCl4 (20 \u00b5L, 20 mM aqueous solution) and\nascorbic acid (20 \u00b5L, 15 mM), followed by heating at 400 \u00b0C in\nair for 2 h. To prepare a 1D nanostructure of platinum, H2PtCl6\nwas used in place of HAuCl4, keeping the other conditions the\nsame. To prepare a 1D nanostructure of SiO2, 2 mg of a\ndiphenylalanine 1D nanostructure as a dried powder was\ntreated with 10 \u00b5L of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) followed by\nheating at 400 \u00b0C in air for 2 h.\nCharacterization of the thin \ufb01lms at the interface was carried\nout by transferring them onto Si(111). A \ufb01eld-emission scanning\nelectron microscope (FEI Nova-Nano SEM-600, The Nether-\nlands) was used to look at their morphology. In the case of\npeptide and amyloid nanostructures, \ufb01lms were coated with\ngold to render them conducting for FESEM studies.

Here, we report a library of \nnaphthalene-dipeptides, their physical chemical properties, and gelation \nability. We have varied both the amino acids in the dipeptides and the \nsubstitution on the naphthalene ring to allow variation of the structure \nthroughout the molecule. We have examined the effects of these permutations on \nthe critical micelle concentration and air-water partition coefficient at high \npH and the apparent pK(a). We show that there is a clear link between these \nproperties and the predicted hydrophobicity of the overall conjugates, rather \nthan the properties varying with, for example, the dipeptide sequence. The \nmajority of these dipeptide-conjugates are effective hydrogelators, although \nthere is no apparent link between the solution properties and whether or not a \nconjugate is a hydrogelator. Nevertheless, where gelation occurs, the link \nbetween hydrophobicity and apparent pK(a) allows the prediction of the pH at \nwhich a gel will be formed and hence informed choice of gelator for specific \napplications.\n\nMaterials. All chemicals and solvents were purchased from\nSigma-Aldrich and used as received. Millipore water (resistivity\n= 18.2 m\u03a9/cm) was used throughout. Full synthesis and char-\nacterization details for the all dipeptides and intermediates are\navailable in the Supporting Information. The Fmoc-dipeptides\nwere synthesized as described elsewhere.34\nTransmission Electron Microscopy. Samples for examina-\ntion by TEM were prepared on Formvar/carbon film coated 400-\nmesh copper grids (Agar scientific). The required amount of GdL\nwas added to a solution of dipeptide derivative (0.5 wt % solution\nat pH 10.7) and allowed to gelate. The gel was sampled by\nremoving 10 \u03bcL, placing on a grid, and allowing adsorption for\n1 min followed by a 1 min wash and two 1 min negative stains\nusing 2% w/v uranyl acetate. Where necessary samples for TEM\nwere prepared in situ by immediately placing grids inverted onto\n10 \u03bcL droplets of the gelation solution. In a humid chamber at\nroom temperature, material was allowed to adsorb onto the grids\nand removed after 120 min followed by 5 min of drying and two\nstains as above. Negatively stained grids were allowed to dry and\nexamined on a Hitachi-7100 TEM operated at 100 kV. Images\nwere acquired digitally using an axially mounted (2000 (cid:2) 2000\npixels) Gatan Ultrascan 1000 CCD camera (Gatan, Oxford, UK).\nSurface Tension Measurements. The surface tension mea-\nsurements were performed on the high throughput Delta-8\nsystem (Kibron Inc.), and the data were analyzed by the\nDelta-8 Manger software. The 200 \u03bcL concentrated dipeptide\nsamples were transferred onto the first column of a standard\nNunclon 96 well plate. A series of concentrations were prepared\nby sequential dilution with pH 9-10 (tested by pH paper) water\nacross the plate, with the concentration decreased by a dilution\nfactor for each column using a transfer-and-mix protocol.\nFinal 50 \u03bcL samples were transferred to the detection plate\nfor measurements.\nThe adsorption isotherm curves of different samples were\nobtained and the apparent air-water partition coefficient (Kaw),\ncross-sectional areas (As), and critical micelle concentration (cmc)\ncalculated based on the Gibbs adsorption equation\nDetermination of the Apparent pKa. A FC200 pH probe\n(HANNA instruments) with a (6 mm (cid:2) 10 mm) conical tip was\nemployed for all pH measurements. The stated accuracy of the pH\nmeasurements is (0.1. The pKa values of dipeptide solutions were\ndetermined by titration via the addition of aliquots of a 0.1 M HCl\nsolution. pH values were recorded until reaching a stable value\nafter each addition during the titration process. To prevent the\nformation of gel, the solutions were gently stirred, thus keeping\nthe solution liquid during the whole \u201ctitration\u201d process. For select\nsamples, heating between aliquot addition and recooling was\ncarried out to check whether mixing and equilibration had\noccurred.22 No deviation between pKa measurements with or\nwithout heating was observed, and hence the values reported\nare for samples without heating.\nGelation Studies. The dipeptide derivative (25.0 mg) was\nsuspended in deionized water (5.00 mL). An equimolar quantity\nof NaOH (0.1 M, aq) was added and the solution gently stirred for\n30 min until a clear solution was formed. The pH of this solution\nwas measured to be 10.7. To prepare hydrogels, solutions were\nadded to measured quantities of glucono-\u03b4-lactone (GdL) accord-\ning to the requirements of final pH and the samples left to stand\nfor 24 h. To obtain the highest pH of gelation, a series of dipeptide\nsamples were prepared with varying concentrations of GdL such\nthat different final pHs of between pH 8 and pH 3 were achieved.\nAfter 24 h, the samples were examined by the vial inversion test.\nThe highest pH of gelation was defined by the pH under which the\nstable gels were formed, and no flow of liquid was found in the\nDetermination of the Minimum Gelation Concentration.\nStock solutions of dipeptide-conjugates at a concentration of\n5 mg/mL (0.5 wt %) were prepared. These were then diluted with\npH 10 water to a number of concentrations. To adjust the pH, for\neach dipeptide-conjugate solution, a number of samples were\nprepared with different quantities of GdL to ensure the prepara-\ntion of samples with a final pH between 3.2 and 3.6. All the\nsamples were left to stand at least 24 h. The minimum gelation\nconcentrations were determined by the lowest concentration at\nwhich a self-supporting gel was formed as determined by the vial\ninversion test.\nRheology. Dynamic rheological experiments were performed\non an Anton Paar Physica MCR101 rheometer. For the oscilla-\ntory shear measurements, a sandblasted parallel top plate with a\n50 mm diameter and 1.0 mm gap distance were used. Gels for\nrheological experiments were prepared on the bottom plate of the\nrheometer by loading a 2.0 mL solution of the gelator immediately\nafter GdL addition. At this point, the sample is still a free-flowing\nliquid. Hence, sample uniformity and reproducibility are high.\nEvaporation of water from the hydrogel was minimized by\ncovering the sides of the plate with low-viscosity mineral oil.\nThe measurements of the shear modulus (storage modulus G0 and\nloss modulus G00) with gelation were made as a function of time at\na frequency of 1.59 Hz (10 rad/s) and at a constant strain of 0.5%\nfor a period of 24 h. To ensure the measurements were made in the\nlinear viscoelastic regime, an amplitude sweep was performed.\nThe results showed no variation in G0 and G00 at a strain of 0.5% as\nused above (see Figures S1-S3 for example data, Supporting\nInformation).\nwhere \u0393 is the surface concentration, \u03b3 is the surface tension, and\nC is the concentration of dipeptide-conjugate in solution.

Raches and Gazit\nhave reported that diphenylglycine, the most generic form of an\naromatic dipeptide, diphenylalanine, can form spherical nano-\nmetric assemblies and these hollow nanospheres have remarkable\nstability, like nanotubes formed by diphenylalanine.23 In a recent\nreport, it is demonstrated that nanovesicles are formed from self-\nassembling dipeptides with a conformationally constrained a,b-\ndihydrophenylalanine residue (DPhe). These vesicles can encap-\nsulate small drugs and other biologically important molecules\nincluding ribo\ufb02avin, vitamin B12, bioactive peptides and even a\nprotein. They are resistant to the proteolytic enzyme, proteinase\nThere are many reports of self-assembled biomolecule based\nvesicular structures. However, vesicular assemblies which contain\nsmall vesicles within their interior compartments, similar to the\ndiscrete organelles within eukaryotic cells, are very rare in the\nliterature25 and the structural control of such assembly has not yet\nbeen achieved properly. There is a need for nano- or microvesicles\ncomposed of biological building blocks, which can deliver the\nencapsulated molecules at the target site in response to a stimulus\nand these vesicles should exhibit minimum or no toxicity, so that\nthey can be used as good delivery vehicles for carrying drugs\nand other biologically important molecules. Peptides 1, 2 and 3\n(Fig. 1) have been selected in such a way that each peptide contains\na C-terminally located hydrophilic glutamic acid residue and the\nA \ufb01eld emission scanning electron microscopic (FE-SEM) study\nhas been performed to investigate the morphological features of\nthese self-assembled peptides. Each of these peptides (0.06 mmol)\nwas dissolved in 1 mL water of pH 6.96 and allowed to age for 24 h.\nThe FE-SEM study clearly demonstrates (Fig. 2) the formation of\nspherical aggregates (nanospheres) having diameters within the\nrange of 90\u2013100 nm for peptide 1, 90\u2013100 nm for the peptide 2\nand 80\u201390 nm for the peptide 3, respectively.\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments were\ncarried out to examine the internal structure of these spherical\naggregates, which were obtained from self-assembling peptides 1,\n2 and 3. No clear and credible images with distinct structural\nfeatures was obtained in the TEM experiments (Fig. S15, ESI\u2020) at\n0.06 mmol mL-1 peptide concentration (i.e. under the conditions\nof the FE-SEM experiment).\nSo, all TEM experiments were performed at a lower con-\ncentration of peptides (0.02 mmol of each peptide in 1 mL of\nwater). These TEM images vividly illustrate the architectural\narrangement of multivesicular assemblies for these self-assembled\npeptides, in which one or more vesicles have been enclosed within\na relatively larger one (Fig. 3 and Fig. S19, ESI\u2020). These peptide\nvesicles are stable within a wide range of pH values (pH 2 to\n12). It is interesting to note that the vesicles within the vesicles\nexist throughout the experimental conditions of different pH\nvalues (Fig. 3, 4, 5). This is probably due to the fact that a\nchange of pH (2\u201312) cannot change the amphiphilic nature of\nthe molecule and the self-assembly pattern in the formation\nof the vesicular structure. In some cases, these assemblies are\nsimilar to the organization of biological eukaryotic cells and\ntheir subcellular organelles (Fig. 3a,b, 4c, 5a,c).25 The sizes of\nthese vesicles obtained from FE-SEM and TEM experiments are\ndifferent as the peptide concentrations that were used for these two\nexperiments were not the same.

The reason behind\nthat is all these amphiphilic peptide molecules (1, 2 and 3) are\nanionic at slightly acidic to neutral pH as well as in basic pH\nand they are sensitive to bivalent cations. In this study, we present\nthe formation of multivesicular architectures (vesicles containing\nsmall vesicles within their interior compartments) from the self-\nassembling water-soluble synthetic dipeptides containing glutamic\nacid as the C-terminal residue. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the \ufb01rst report of multivesicular architectures obtained from\nwater-soluble synthetic anionic dipeptides. In this report, it has\nbeen demonstrated that these peptide-based vesicles are stable\nover a wide pH range (pH 2\u201312), and responsive to Ca+2 ions.\nMoreover, a \ufb02uorescent dye (eosin B) and an anticancer drug\n(doxorubicin) can be encapsulated inside these vesicles and these\nencapsulated materials can be released in the presence of calcium\nions. The nontoxic nature of these dye/drug-loaded vesicles has\nalso been demonstrated using MTT (3,4-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-\n2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) cell survival assay. A cellular\nuptake study using vesicles loaded with biologically important\nmolecules like cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) demon-\nstrates that these vesicles not only enter into the cells but also\ncan successfully deliver the entrapped molecules within the cells\nkeeping their biological functions intact.

As could be observed\nFig. 1 Morphological characterization by scanning electron microscopy of\nthe structures assembled by WW\u2013((CT)5T2): (a) spherical structures assembled\nat low concentration (below 1 mM) whereas (b) fibres developed at high\nconcentration under controlled aggregation (time and temperature).\nby transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM and SEM),\ndirect dissolution in aqueous solution induced the spontaneous\nformation of spherical structures of about 300 nm size (Fig. 1a and\nFig. S3, ESI\u2020). An apparent hydrodynamic radius (230 nm) of the\nspherical structures assembled in the low concentration regime was\ndetermined by dynamic light scattering (Fig. S4, ESI\u2020), which was in\nagreement with the size estimated by electron microscopy. The\ndipeptide itself is not soluble in pure water but spherical structures\nassembled in an aqueous solution of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-\npropanol (HFIP) (1 : 50 v/v HFIP/H2O ratio) (Fig. 2). Removal of\nthe organic solvent induces the precipitation of the dipeptide.\nStructure formation in the aqueous solution of HFIP occurs\nowing to the polar property of the indole ring of tryptophan,\nwhich acts as a quadruple as demonstrated in the formation of\nvesicular structures from N-alkylindoles.9\nThe peptide\u2013DNA hybrid might therefore form the observed\nfibrils by both p\u2013p stacking and hydrogen bonding according to\na nucleation polymerization process comparable to the one that\ninduces the formation of polypeptide fibrils.11 The 230 nm size\nspherical structures would then act as seeds for this mecha-\nnism to take place. As described by Hamley, polypeptide fibril\nformation occurs by the interaction between the common main\nchain polypeptide backbone whereas folding is due to specific\ninteractions of the side chains.11 At low concentration, spherical\nstructures formed by WW\u2013DNA is induced by the chemical and\nphysical incompatibility between the dipeptide and nucleic acid\nstrands and stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the nucleo-\ntide sequences engaged in structure formation. These spherical\nstructures at higher concentrations and under controlled aggre-\ngation (time and temperature) might develop into fibres by\nnucleation dependent polymerization.\nWe could thus resort to label-free fluorescence spectroscopy\namenable by the WW dipeptide intrinsic fluorescence to evidence\nthis mechanism of structure formation and the putative role of the\ninteractions involved. This peculiar property of WW is sensitive to\nthe polarity of the environment. Since the supramolecular struc-\ntures are held by non-covalent interactions, they disassemble below\na critical aggregation concentration (cac), which was quantified by\nfluorescence spectroscopy (Fig. 3). Fig. 4 shows the corresponding\nconcentration dependent fluorescence spectra. The dilution course\nof the fluorescence intensity shows that below 0.1 mM the struc-\ntures started to disassemble as further evidenced by SEM (Fig. S5,\nESI\u2020). The role of hydrogen bonding in stabilization of the spherical\nstructures was further supported by incubation with a chaotropic\nagent, urea, which also induced their disassembly as imaged by\nSEM (data not shown) and fluorescence spectroscopy (Fig. S6, ESI\u2020).\nThese experimental results demonstrate that the spherical struc-\ntures are stabilized by hydrogen bonding, which occurs between the\nnucleotide sequences engaged in structure formation. This was\nfurther supported by the disassembly of the spherical struc-\ntures by the addition of synthetic nucleic acid strands (either\ncomplementary or non-complementary) in the surrounding\nmedium (Fig. S7, ESI\u2020).\nFig. 2 Spherical structures of WW dipeptide in aqueous solution of HFIP\nas observed by (a) scanning electron microscopy and (b) transmission\nelectron microscopy.\nFig. 4 Fluorescence emission spectra for decreasing concentrations of the\nWW\u2013DNA hybrid. (a) 2 mM, (b) 1 mM, (c) 0.5 mM, (d) 0.25 mM, (e) 0.13 mM,\nand (f) 0.06 mM.\nsequences in the medium (Fig. S8, ESI\u2020) a\ufb00ects the organiza-\ntion into spherical structures of the WW\u2013DNA. With increasing\nconcentration of the nucleic acid strands, disassembly occurs\n(Fig. S9, ESI\u2020). Moreover, as can be observed in Fig. 4, the\nfluorescence intensity maximum (lmax at 370 nm) increases with\nincreasing concentration and the maximum is reached at a concen-\ntration of 0.5 mM. On further increasing the concentration (1 mM),\nthe intensity of this peak decreases and a red-shifted signal appears\nat 476 nm. On further increasing the concentration to 2 mM, this\nfeature becomes more prominent. This red shifted peak is an\nindication of the presence of an extensive J-type aggregate, which\nresults from the p\u2013p stacking of aromatic rings. These types of\naggregates were indeed observed previously in other systems.12 This\nis further evidenced by SEM (Fig. 1). WW\u2013DNA hybrids organize\ninto spherical structures at concentrations between 0.05 mM and\n0.5 mM. On further increasing the concentration (1 mM), they self-\nassemble to long fibres. These experimental results indicate that\nstructures formed at high concentrations are supported by the\ninteraction of the aromatic WW dipeptide in agreement with reports\npublished previously by Reches and Gazit13 as well as Verma and\ncoworkers.4a We unfortunately could not resort to CD spectroscopy\nto evidence further p\u2013p stacking. Both the nucleic acid strand and\nWW\u2013DNA hybrid induce a negative shift at 218 nm (Fig. S10, ESI\u2020).\nIn addition to p\u2013p stacking of WW residues, the nucleic acid\nstrands might also undergo hydrogen bonding in the fibrillar\nstructure. To assess the role of these interactions, we grafted the\nWW dipeptide to a water soluble polymer, poly(ethylene glycol)\n(PEG, MW = 2000). Unlike a nucleotide sequence, PEG does not\nengage in specific hydrogen bonding. Long needle shaped fibres of\nabout 50 nm width were observed by TEM (Fig. S11, ESI\u2020). Unlike\nWW\u2013DNA, no spheres were assembled by WW\u2013PEG at low concen-\ntration. Similar results were previously reported for PEG-FFFF.12a\nThe authors associated the finite length of the PEG\u2013tetrapeptide\nhybrid with the end cap energy due to the hydrophobicity of the\npeptide. WW\u2013PEG thus assembles through b-sheet formation at\nhigh concentration due to the p\u2013p stacking of the amino acids\nwhich is in agreement with J-type aggregation, as observed for the\nWW\u2013DNA hybrids through fluorescence spectroscopy (Fig. 4).\nIt further shows that hydrogen bonding plays a key role in the\nformation of the long WW\u2013DNA fibres. Besides, it has to be\nemphasized that fibrils could not be assembled by the WW\u2013DNA\nhybrid in presence of the complementary nucleotide sequence of\nthe one involved in structure formation (data not shown). More-\nover, the fibres could not be disassembled by the addition of the\ncomplementary sequence subsequent to fibril formation which\nstrongly supports the involvement of hydrogen bonding in WW\u2013\nDNA fibrils formation in support of p\u2013p stacking. The WW\u2013DNA\nhybrid organizes according to a mechanism analogous to that of\nthe nucleation polymerization of polypeptide fibrils as further\nevidenced by the monitoring of the time course of the dipeptide\nfluorescence (Fig. 5). The peak assigned to the formation of J-type\naggregates appears after 6 hours of incubation.\nIn conclusion, we report here on the successful coupling of\nthe ditryptophan dipeptide to a synthetic nucleotide sequence.\nThe resulting hybrid forms spherical structures in dilute aqueous\nsolution. At high concentration and under controlled aggregation\nFig. 5 Time course of the fluorescence intensity monitored upon assembly\nof WW\u2013DNA (0.5 mM) at time intervals 0 (t0), 6 (t6) and 24 hours (t24).\n(time and temperature), the formation of fibrils has been\nobserved.

The cross-sections of the tubes have pronounced reg-\nular shapes, allowing to relate them to de\ufb01nite crystallographic\nclasses, where FF-PNT have nanocrystalline hexagonal symmetry\nP61 [17\u201319] and LL-PNT possesses orthorhombic symmetry of\nP212121 [20,21]. However, despite of similar hydrophobic origin,\nleading to wrapping of FF and LL peptides into similar native\nnanotubes, at this initial phase, crystallization of both dipeptides\ngoes at the nanoscale into different space group structures. We\nassume that the self-assembly process of FF-native PNT and LL-\nnative PNT is determined by their various molecular recognition\nmechanisms, aromatic and non-aromatic. Both bioorganic nano-\nstructures are related to the structures without center of symme-\ntry, which is the basis for observation of a wide spectrum of\nferroelectric and related phenomena, such as piezoelectric effect,\nelectrical spontaneous polarization [18,22] and second order\nnonlinear response [12].\nWe found that native FF and LL nanotubes undergo irreversible\nphase transition. In the same temperature region (T = 140\u2013180 \u00b0\nC), both FF-PNT and LL-PNT change drastically their nanotube\nmorphology and adopt a shape of ultrathin \ufb01ber-like nanostruc-\nture, as evident from Figure 2. FF nanotubes demonstrate gradual\ngrowing needle-like thin wire-\ufb01brils. Our previous data [17,19]\nshowed for a single FF nanotube that heated open-end FF-PNT\nis gradually close its central hole and transformed into \ufb01ber or\ninto a bundle of \ufb01bers. The same transformation is also observed\nin LL nanotubes when they split into very thin nano\ufb01brils. Found\nsimilar morphological recon\ufb01rmation into nano\ufb01brils in both FF-PNT\nand LL-PNT can be classi\ufb01ed as reconstructive phase transition [17].\nWe revealed that both newly assembled FF and LL \ufb01brillar structures\nduring heating (Figure 2) changed their native asymmetric crystal\nstructure into centrosymmetric. These results are based on our\nprevious investigations, which showed that the piezoelectric and\nnonlinear optical properties of FF-PNT and LL-PNT disappear after\nheating at temperature above 120\u2013140 \u00b0C [17].\nFigure 2.

Previous studies that demonstrated\npositive CD spectrum of FF-based nanostructures ascribed them to\na \u03b2-turn conformation [28,30]. The negative CD spectrum recorded\nin the range of 210\u2013220 nm was observed in our thermally induced\nFF-PNF after high temperature treatment (Figure 4a) and is\nindicated on a typical \u03b2-sheet structure signature [24].\nTo the best of our knowledge, the origin of the positive CD\nband of native LL-PNT at room temperature and its relation to\nany secondary structure was not studied. However, the negative\nCD spectrum that was recorded in the thermally induced LL\nnano\ufb01brils at high temperature is similar to the CD spectra of\nother aliphatic [33,34] and aromatic peptides [28] and can be re-\nlated to the \u03b2-sheet arrangements of the LL dipeptide molecules.\nThe formation of a \u03b2-sheet structure of the LL molecules is in\nagreement with the tendency of proteins with high content of\nleucine amino acid to form \u03b1/\u03b2 arrangement [35].\nThe deep variation of the CD spectra of FF and LL nanostruc-\ntures during heating indicates that the secondary arrangement\nof FF and LL nano\ufb01brils strongly depends on temperature. Envi-\nronmental conditions can affect the arrangements of molecules,\nwhich are expressed in different CD bands of the same molecule\n[28,36]. Heat treatment could also alter the CD bands [37] and even\nreverse the samples\u2019 chirality [38]. In our case, thermal treatment of\nFF-PNT and LL-PNT induces a \u03b2-sheet conformation, accompanied\nwith a change in the crystal structure symmetry [17]. Thus, although\nnative FF-PNT and LL-PNT are self-assembled by dissimilar\nintermolecular interactions because of their molecular composition\nof different origin, both dipeptide nanostructures rearrange into\na similar \u03b2-sheet secondary structure, accompanied by similar \ufb01-\nbril morphology. It should also be noted that the morphology\nand \u03b2-sheet secondary structure of both aromatic and aliphatic\npeptides are similar to amyloid nano\ufb01brils [5,39].\nIn contrast to the crystal-related physical properties of FF-PNT\nand LL-PNT (piezoelectric and second order nonlinear optical re-\nsponse), linear optical properties (such as optical absorption and\nPL) are de\ufb01ned by the electronic structure of the self-assembled\npeptide nanotubular structures. In our recent studies [7,17], we\nfound an emission peak at 290 nm from the aromatic FF-PNT,\nexcited at 265 nm. We found that this PL peak does not change\nwith temperature, and we believe that it stems from the aromatic\nresidues of FF molecules [40]. Recent publications showed that\nthe addition or loss of water molecules affects the FF molecule\u2019s\natomic vibrations and thus in\ufb02uences their optical characteristics\nonly in the UV region [41]. Aliphatic native LL-PNT does not pos-\nsess any PL properties at all and, as we found in this work, does\nnot exhibit any peak in the optical absorption.\nDuring thermal treatment, both FF and LL native nanotubes\nchange their morphology into a \ufb01ber-like structure (Figure 2).\nThis morphological transition is accompanied by deep transfor-\nmation of their optical properties. As the temperature increases\nto T ~120\u2013140 \u00b0C, a blue PL peak in the region 420\u2013460 nm ap-\npears both in FF and LL nanostructures and gradually grows until\nT ~180 \u00b0C (depicted in Figure 5). The narrow sharp peak observed\nin the LL \ufb01ber structure, located at \u03bb = 411 nm, does not depend\non temperature and is associated with the Raman scattering in\nwater, where its peak position is located exactly at wavenumber\n3600 cm(cid:1)1 lower than the excitation wavenumber [42]. Because\nthe sample was measured within an aqueous solution, a water-\nmark was expected.\nSeveral models have been proposed to explain the origin of\nthe blue light photon emission from the FF-PNF during heating,\nsuch as quantum con\ufb01nement\n[8] and cyclization process\n[19,43]. However, we can conclude that blue PL peak observed\nin FF and LL ultrashort peptide nano\ufb01brils can be ascribed to\ntheir similar secondary peptide nanostructures and most likely\nis related to a \u03b2-sheet secondary structure as was found by us\nin this study (Figure 4). This phenomenon should be also valid\nto other peptides, which are natively rich in \u03b2-sheets, without\nthe need of thermal treatment. Recently, it was observed that\nFmoc-FF hydrogels, which possess \u03b2-sheet conformation, exhibit\na blue PL peak in 460 nm without any thermal treatment [27].\nThese \ufb01ndings support our assumption about the origin of blue\nPL peak in our dipeptide FF and LL nano\ufb01brils.\nAs we noted before, the same blue PL peak was recently found\nin amyloid \ufb01brils having similar nano\ufb01brilar structure [5,6]. Origi-\nnal amyloid \ufb01brils are known to have a \u03b2-sheet structure that is\nstabilized by hydrogen bonds between the components of the \ufb01-\nber. Such hydrogen bonds are also formed in the thermally\nFigure 5. PL and PLE spectra in the blue-visible spectral region of (a) FF-PNF\nand (b) LL-PNF during heating. As the temperature increases to T ~120\u2013140 \u00b0C,\na blue PL peak in the region 420\u2013460 nm appears both in the FF and LL\nnanostructures and gradually grows until T ~180 \u00b0C. (The peak at 411 nm that\nappears in the PL spectra of LL nanotubes is associated with Raman peak as-\ncribed to water because of the experimental conditions).\nRecently, several studies reported on the observation of a blue\nlight emission in large crystalline proteins with lack of aromatic-\nity, such as gamma-II crystalline [47], diseased-related human\npeptides, lysozyme [5] and other amyloid-like \ufb01brils formed by\npeptides [48,49]. The common feature to all these \ufb01brils was that\nthey are all rich in \u03b2-sheets secondary structures [5]. As such, the\nmost accede speculation to the appearance of the blue visible\n\ufb02uorescence is that hydrogen bonds in \u03b2-sheet structure can\ncause low energy electronic transitions [5,47], and hence the\nemission of a low-wavelength light in the blue visible region is\npossible. In addition, it was suggested that the amyloid state of"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"peptide_sequence\": \"FF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"fiber\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"2/98 HFP/H2O\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"2.0\", \"PH\": \"5.2\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"180.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"180.0\"}, {\"peptide_sequence\": \"LL\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"tube\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"2/98 HFP/H2O\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"2.0\", \"PH\": \"5.2\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"nan\"}, {\"peptide_sequence\": \"LL\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"fiber\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"2/98 HFP/H2O\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"2.0\", \"PH\": \"5.2\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"180.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"90.0\"}]"}]}

All peptides (Figure\n1, NapFF, NapFFKK, NapFFFKK, NapFFOO, NapFFK\u2032K\u2032) were\nsynthesized following standard Fmoc solid phase protocols on Wang\nresin, using a manual nitrogen bubbler apparatus.

Peptides were prepared and tested for gelation\ncharacteristics at concentrations of 2.0, 1.5, 1.0 and 0.5% w/v as\npreviously outlined.13 Peptides were initially suspended in 200 \u03bcL\nsterile deionized water. All peptides possessed a terminal carboxylic\nacid moiety. Therefore, increasing the pH of the solution to pH 9, via\ntitration with 1 M NaOH, resulted in deprotonation of the terminal\nspecies and full dissolution. Protonation of the terminal carboxylic acid\nvia subsequent titration with 0.5 M HCl to pH 6\u22127 resulted in the\nformation of a homogeneous gel at concentrations above the\nminimum gelation concentration for the peptide. The pH was veri\ufb01ed\nusing Whatman pH paper. Gels were allowed to develop for 24 h. Self-\nassembly and the formation of a self-supporting gel was veri\ufb01ed\nthrough the use of an inversion assay, as previously described.22 Gels\nand solutions were di\ufb00erentiated based on \ufb02ow characteristics with\nsolutions demonstrating \ufb02ow properties and gels remaining suspended.\nCryo-Scanning Electron Microscopy (Cryo-SEM).

TEM was performed\nusing a FEI Morgagni 268 transmission electron microscope (FEI\nelectronics, Burlington, Massachusetts, U.S.A.) and a negative staining\ntechnique.24 400 mesh copper grids were coated with continuous thick\ncarbon \ufb01lm (\u223c35 nm) having been previously glow discharged to\nincrease their hydrophilicity. Samples (4 \u03bcL) were placed on the grid\nand rinsed three times with doubled distilled water. The grid was\nstained three times by a 2% w/v solution of uranyl acetate. Excess stain\nsolution from the edge of the grid was removed using \ufb01lter paper.\nGrids were allowed to air-dry before immediate examination.\nFourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Hydrogel\nsamples (2\u22120.5% w/v) were prepared as described previously but with\nD2O replacing water.25 Prepared D2O containing hydrogels were\nsandwiched between two CaF2 25 mm2 discs (0.05 mm spacer). FTIR\nspectra were obtained using a Jasco 4000 series FTIR spectrometer\n(Jasco Inc. Tokyo, Japan), between the wavelengths 4000\u2212400 cm\u22121\nwith resolution 2 cm\u22121 and an average of 128 scans. The spectrum of\ndeuterated water was used as a background and subtracted from all\nCircular Dichroism (CD). CD was performed using a Jasco J815\nSpectropolarimeter and quartz cuvette 1 mm path length, with 1 s\nintegrations, 1 accumulation, and a step size of 1 nm with a bandwidth\nof 1 nm over a range of wavelengths from 180 to 300 nm at 25 \u00b0C.\nPeptide samples were prepared 24 h previously to allow for\nhydrogelation. Measurements were repeated three times and mean\nvalue plotted. Control samples (sterile distilled water, 1 M NaOH, 0.5\nM HCl, pH 7.4) did not display any signal.\nOscillatory Rheology. The viscoelastic properties of the samples\nwere determined using oscillatory rheology performed on a TA\nAR1500 rheometer at 25 \u00b0C. A 20 mm steel parallel plate was\nemployed with a set gap of 500 \u03bcm. 400 \u03bcL samples were applied to\nthe plate using a pipetman. An oscillatory stress sweep was performed\nto determine the linear viscoelastic region (LVR) of each sample. This\nregion, which is determined according to a superposition principle, is\nthe area where stress is directly proportional to strain. There is a linear\nrelationship between the two variables. Following this, an appropriate\nstress within the LVR was selected and a frequency sweep was\nperformed at the range 1\u221210 Hz with the selected stress remaining\nconstant for each sample. Three distinct replicates for each sample\nwere obtained and the storage modulus (G\u2032) and loss modulus (G\u2033)\ndetermined.\nHinton Broth (MHB) for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C before testing. Upon visual\ncon\ufb01rmation of growth, the inoculum was taken and adjusted to\noptical density 0.3 at 550 nm in Quarter Strength Ringers Solution\n(QSRS), equivalent to 1 \u00d7 108 colony forming units per milliter\n(CFU/mL). This suspension was further diluted in MHB (1 in 50)\nand dispensed aseptically in 100 \u03bcL aliquots to each well of the\nmicrotiter plate, corresponding to 2 \u00d7 106 CFU/mL. Bio\ufb01lms were\nformed on the surface of the well under shear stress provided by a\nGallenkamp gyrorotary incubator at 37 \u00b0C. After an inoculation period\nof 24 h, cultures were decanted and the plates irrigated thrice with 200\n\u03bcL of sterile autoclaved 0.9% w/v sodium chloride (NaCl) in each\nwell. Washed plates were tapped gently upside down on a sterile paper\ntowel to remove residual wash. The prepared bio\ufb01lm was treated for\nevaluation of viability using alamarBlue in a method similar to that\nused by Pettit.26 Then, 100 \u03bcL of 2.0 1.5, 1.0 and 0.5% w/v NapFF,\nNapFFKK, NapFFFKK, NapFFOO, and NapFFK\u2032K\u2032 was pipetted\ninto separate wells of the microtiter plate and bio\ufb01lms assessed for\nreduction in viability after 24 h exposure. Gels were removed from the\nmicrotiter plates by three rinses of each well with NaCl. A range (3\u2212\n0.5% w/v) of HPMC gels (see Supporting Information, Figure S21)\nwere used as a standard non-antimicrobial hydrogel comparator to\nensure removal of gels did not remove a signi\ufb01cant quantity of bio\ufb01lm\nbacteria. HPMC has previously been shown to possess no signi\ufb01cant\nantimicrobial activity.27 HPMC displayed no signi\ufb01cant reduction of\nviable bio\ufb01lm compared to positive controls (no gel), thus ensuring\nthe validity of the assay and methods employed. The viability of\nestablished bio\ufb01lms is assessed by recharging wells with 100 \u03bcL of\nMHB containing 20% v/v alamarBlue, incubating the plate at 37 \u00b0C\nfor 2 h to allow development,\nfollowed by spectrophotometric\nmeasurement of absorbance at a wavelength of 570 nm (Tecan Sunrise\nplate reader). AlamarBlue contains resazurin, a redox indicator that is\nreduced by the metabolic activity of viable microbial cells to develop\ninto pink \ufb02uorescent resorfurin. Positive control (100% microbicidal\ne\ufb00ect) corresponds to blank wells (no bacterial bio\ufb01lm) treated with\n70% ethanol (added, removed and allowed to dry) immediately prior\nto the addition of 20% v/v alamarBlue. Eight\nreplicates were\nperformed at each concentration. Reduction in viability of bio\ufb01lm\nfollowing exposure to test formulation is expressed as a percentage\nbased on percent reduction between untreated (blank) wells and\ntreated wells using the following equation:\nCell Viability Assay. Murine \ufb01broblast subcutaneous connective\ntissue cell line, NCTC Clone 929 (ATCC CCL 1), was cultured in\nMinimum Essential Medium (MEM) containing phenol red with\nEarle\u2019s Salts and L-glutamine, supplemented with 10% Horse Serum,\n100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin supplied by\nInvitrogen (Paisley, U.K.). Cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 and\nsubcultured at 80\u221290% con\ufb02uency. Subculturing consisted of removal\nof spent medium, rinsing of the adherent cell surface with sterile\nautoclaved PBS before treatment with a 0.05% trypsin/0.53 mM\nEDTA\u00b74Na solution (Invitrogen, Paisley, U.K.) for cell monolayer\ndetachment. Cell viability was assessed by means of a quantitative\nalamarBlue assay, similar to that utilized by O\u2019Brien and colleagues.28\nCells were cultured (until at least third passage) and inoculated into\n96-well tissue culture treated microtiter plates at a concentration of 1\n\u00d7 104 cells/well and incubated at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 24 \u00b1 1 h,\nuntil approximately 90% con\ufb02uency. After this time, the medium was\nremoved and replaced with 100 \u03bcL of 2.0 1.5, 1.0, and 0.5% w/v\nNapFF, NapFFKK, NapFFFKK, NapFFOO, NapFFK\u2032K\u2032 in separate\nwells of the microtiter plate and cell monolayers exposed for 24 h.\nAbsorption was measured at 570 nm in a Tecan Sunrise plate reader\nafter a development time of 10 h. A positive control (100% reduction\nin viability) was also included in the assay using 70% ethanol. The\nnegative control (untreated) consisted of tissue culture cells in 100 \u03bcL\nphosphate bu\ufb00er saline (PBS). Percentage cell viability was calculated\nrelative to untreated control wells as per the bio\ufb01lm assay above. This\nvalue was subtracted from 100 to provide a percentage viability value\ndisplayed in Figure 6. The 3\u22120.5% w/v HPMC controls (Supporting\nInformation Figure S22) displayed no signi\ufb01cant reduction of viable\n\ufb01broblast cells compared to positive controls (no gels),\ncon\ufb01rming the validity of the study.\nHemolysis. All peptide gels/solutions were assayed spectrophoto-\nmetrically for their ability to induce hemoglobin release from fresh\nequine erythrocytes according to the method previously described.21\nFresh de\ufb01brinated equine erythrocytes were washed three times with\nequal volumes of PBS. After centrifugation for 15 min at 900 g\nerythrocytes were resuspended to 4% v/v in PBS. Equal volumes (100\n\u03bcL) of the erythrocyte suspension were added to each well of a 96-well\nmicrotiter plate. Erythrocytes were subsequently exposed to peptide\nconcentrations of 2.0\u22120.5% w/v,\nincubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, and\ncentrifuged at 1000g. Aliquots of the supernatant were transferred to a\nfresh 96-well microtiter plate, and hemoglobin release measured\nspectrophotometrically at 405 nm (Tecan Sunrise plate reader). As a\npositive control (100% hemolysis), erythrocytes were treated with\n0.1% Triton X-100, while PBS (0% hemolysis) acted as a negative\ncontrol. All peptide concentrations are reported as the mean of six\nreplicates. Percentage hemolysis was calculated as follows:\nStatistical Analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using\nGraphPad Prism 6. Standard deviations were obtained at each\nconcentration of peptide tested based on eight\nquantitative bio\ufb01lm viability assays and mean values obtained. For\ncell cytotoxicity assays standard deviations and mean values were also\nobtained from eight\nreplicates at each concentration. Statistical\nanalyses were employed using a Kruskal\u2212Wallis test, with a Dunn\u2019s\nmultiple comparisons test used to identify individual di\ufb00erences\nbetween the reduction in bio\ufb01lm viability for each peptide hydrogel\nand the positive control (0% reduction). A Kruskal\u2212Wallis test,\nfollowed by a Dunn\u2019s multiple comparisons test, was also utilized for\nstatistical analysis of tissue culture cytotoxicity data by comparison of\npercentage viability for the peptides employed to the positive control\n(100% viability), with signi\ufb01cant\nreduction in viability reported.\nHemolysis data was compared by the same statistical method with\npercentage hemolysis compared to the PBS, nonhemolytic, control\n(0% hemolysis). Non-parametric Kruskal\u2212Wallis tests were employed\nrather than parametric Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) as data was\nshown to be non-normally distributed using the Kolmogorov and\nSmirnov method. In all cases, a probability of P < 0.05 denoted\nsigni\ufb01cance."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"peptide_sequence\": \"FF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"hydrogel\",

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "polypeptide self-assembly literature information extraction"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Supramolecular self-assembly offers an efficient pathway for creating \nmacroscopically chiral structures in biology and materials science. Here, a new \npeptide consisting of an N-(9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) headgroup connected to \nan aromatic phenylalanine-tryptophan dipeptide and terminated with zwitterionic \nlysine (Fmoc-FWK) and its cationic form (Fmoc-FWK-NH2) were designed for \nself-assembly into chiral structures. It was found that the Fmoc-FWK peptide \nself-assembled into left-handed helical nanoribbons at pH 11.2-11.8, whereas it \nformed nanofibers at pH 5 and 12 and large flat ribbons composed of many \nnanofibers in the pH range of 6-11. However, only nanofibers were observed in \nthe cases of Fmoc-FWK-NH2 at different values. A series of structural \ncharacterizations based on CD, FTIR, UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy reveal \nthat the electrostatic and aromatic interactions and the associated hydrogen \nbonding direct the self-assembly into various structures. The enhanced \u03c0-\u03c0 \nstacking and hydrogen bonding were found in the helical nanoribbons. This \ndifference in intermolecular interactions should be derived from the ionization \nof carboxyl and amino groups from lysine residues at different pH values. \nFurthermore, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to gain insight into \nthe assembly mechanisms. The results imply that a relatively rigid molecular \nconformation and the strong intramolecular aromatic interaction between Trp and \nFmoc groups favor chiral self-assembly. This study is the first attempt to \ndesign a Fmoc-tripeptide for the fabrication of helical structures with \nmacroscopic chirality, which provides a successful example and allows us to \ncreate new peptide-based chiral assembly systems.\n\nMaterials. N-(9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)-phenylalanine-trypto-\nphan-lysine (Fmoc-Phe-Trp-Lys-OH, Fmoc-FWK, 98%), N-(9-\ufb02uo-\nrenyl methoxycarbonyl)-phenylalanine-tryptophan-lysine-NH2 (Fmoc-\nFWK-NH2, 98%), and phenylalanine-tryptophan-lysine (FWK, 98%)\nwere synthesized by GL Biochem Ltd. (China). All other chemicals\nwere of analytical grade and were obtained from commercial sources.\nPreparation of Fmoc-FWK Helical Nanoribbons. In a typical\nexperiment, the lyophilized Fmoc-FWK peptide was dissolved in a\nmixed solvent of acetonitrile\u2212H2O (v/v = 1) at a concentration of 35\nmg mL\u22121 at 60 \u00b0C. The resulting peptide solution was then diluted to\na \ufb01nal concentration of 7 mg mL\u22121 in an aqueous solution at pH 11.5.\nWithin several seconds, a peptide hydrogel was formed and then aged\nat room temperature for 1 day without disturbance to ensure complete\nself-assembly. For Fmoc-FWK-NH2 peptides, the peptide assemblies\nwere obtained following the same procedure as described before. To\ninvestigate the e\ufb00ect of pH on self-assembly, aqueous solutions with\ndi\ufb00erent pH values ranging from 5 to 12 were used.\nCompositional Analysis. The chemical compositions of\nhydrogels formed at pH 7, 9, 10 and 11.5, respectively, were measured\nby high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid\nchromatography\u2212mass spectrometry (LC\u2212MS). Speci\ufb01cally,\nformed hydrogels were directly freeze dried and then dissolved in\nacetonitrile solvent. The concentrations of Fmoc-FWK and its\nhydrolysate (FWK) were determined using an Agilent HPLC 1200\nsystem (Agilent Technologies, USA) equipped with a UV\u2212vis detector\noperated at 220 nm on a Venusil MP-C18 column (5 \u03bcm, 4.6 mm \u00d7\n250 mm, Tianjin Bonna-Agela Technologies Ltd., China). The mobile\nphase was composed of acetonitrile and water with increasing\nacetonitrile content from 20 to 70% over 25 min at a total \ufb02ow rate\nof 1 mL min\u22121. The pure Fmoc-FWK and FWK were used as\nstandards to produce the calibration curve for\nthe quantitative\ncalculation. Both chemicals were further con\ufb01rmed by LC\u2212MS\nanalysis, which was performed on a Agilent 1200 HPLC system\ncoupled to an Agilent 6310 ion-trap mass spectrometer (Agilent\nTechnologies, USA) with an ESI source, operated in positive-ion\nRheological Measurement. Rheological measurements were\ncarried out using a Stress Tech rheological instrument (Rheological\nInstruments AB CO., Sweden). The stock peptide solution (35 mg\nmL\u22121) was poured onto the plate of the instrument, which was held at\n25 \u00b0C by using an integrated temperature controller. Then, an aqueous\nsolution at pH 5, 7, or 11.5 was added immediately. The storage\nmodulus G\u2032 and loss modulus G\u2033 were measured as a function of time\nat a constant frequency of 1 rad s\u22121. After 30 min, a frequency sweep\n(0.1\u221250 Hz) test was conducted to measure the frequency-dependent\nstorage and loss shear moduli.\nMorphological Characterization. The hydrogels were frozen at\n\u221245 \u00b0C and subsequently dried under vacuum. All samples were\nsputter-coated with platinum using an E1045 Pt-coater (Hitachi High-\ntechnologies CO., Japan) and then imaged with an S-4800 \ufb01eld\nemission scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi High-\ntechnologies CO., Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 3 keV. The\nmorphology of the peptide assemblies was further assessed using a\nJEOL 100CX-II transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL Ltd.,\nJapan) operated at 80 keV. To prepare samples, the hydrogel was\ndispersed in ddH2O, and a 10 \u03bcL aliquot of aqueous dispersion was\nplaced onto a 300 mesh carbon-coated copper grid, air dried, and then\nnegatively stained with 1 wt % phosphotungstic acid solution for 2 min\nbefore imaging. The samples for atomic force microscopy (AFM)\nmeasurement were prepared as follows: the hydrogel was dispersed in\nddH2O, and a 100 \u03bcL aliquot of the aqueous dispersion was spread on\na mica surface and air dried before observation. AFM images were\nrecorded using an Agilent 5500 atomic force microscope (Agilent,\nUSA) equipped with N9797 AU-1FP Pico software in tapping mode.\nStructural Characterization. Circular dichroism (CD) analysis\nwas performed on a Jasco J-810 CD spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc.,\nJapan) over a wavelength range of 185\u2212350 nm with a resolution of 1\nnm. Spectra were recorded three times using a scanning speed of 100\nnm min\u22121 with a bandwidth of 1 nm. Fourier transform infrared\nspectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of xerogels were recorded on a Nicolet-\n560 FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet Co., USA) with a KBr pellet method\nacross the range of 400\u22124000 cm\u22121. A total of 16 scans were\naccumulated with a resolution of 4 cm\u22121 for each spectrum. UV\u2212vis\nspectra were monitored on a TU-1810 UV\u2212vis spectrophotometer\n(Persee Instruments Ltd., China) with a wavelength range of 200\u2212700\nnm. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Cary Eclipse\nspectro\ufb02uorometer (Agilent CO., USA) with excitation at 280 nm.\nAll \ufb02uorescence spectra were recorded at 25 \u00b0C. The excitation and\nemission slit widths were \ufb01xed at 5 and 5 nm, respectively.\nFigure 1. (a) Molecular structure of the Fmoc-FWK peptide. (b) SEM, (c, d) AFM, and (e, f) TEM images of the Fmoc-FWK helical nanoribbons\nformed at pH 11.5.\nprepare the peptide solutions, 1 mg of Fmoc-FWK peptide was\ndissolved in 1 mL of ddH2O. The pH of the resulting solution was\nadjusted with 0.5 M NaOH or 0.1 M HCl. A pH meter was used to\nmeasure the pH values of all of the solutions. For peptide assemblies,\nthe peptide hydrogel was synthesized as mentioned before and then\ndispersed in ddH2O to a \ufb01nal concentration of 0.07 mg mL\u22121.\npH Titration. Fmoc-FWK-OH or Fmoc-FWK-NH2 peptides were\ndissolved in ddH2O at a concentration of 10 mmol L\u22121 at pH 2.5 by\nadding 0.1 M HCl. The titration curves were recorded by monitoring\nthe pH values during the stepwise addition of small volumes of 0.5 M\nNaOH. The samples were stirred to ensure complete mixing during\nthe titration process. No signi\ufb01cant di\ufb00erence (0.3 pH unit) was\nobserved between the two pH measurements. The pH measurements\nwere performed using a TitroLine Alpha Plus AutomaticTitrator\n(Scott CO., Germany).\nMolecular Dynamics Simulations. Hydrogen atoms of\nFmoc-tripeptide residues were added using Discovery Studio (version\n2.5.5, Accelrys). The system was centered in a cubic box of TIP3P\nwater molecules, and a su\ufb03cient number of Na+ ions and HPO4\nH2PO4\u2212 were added to neutralize the negative charges. A CHARMm\nforce \ufb01eld was used to assign molecules, and classical molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations were performed using Discovery Studio\n(version 2.5.5, Accelrys). The system energy was \ufb01rst minimized by\nperforming 5000 steps using the steepest descent algorithm, followed\nby an additional 2000 steps of minimization using the conjugate\ngradient method. Then,\nthe system was heated to the target\ntemperature of 300 K for a period of 2 ps under constant-pressure\nperiodic boundary conditions (NPT). Subsequently, the system was\nallowed to equilibrate for 1 ps at constant pressure and temperature\n(NPT) with a time step of 1 fs, followed by 1 ns of production\nsimulation performed under the same conditions. A cuto\ufb00 of 14 \u00c5 was\nused for nonbonded interactions, and long-range electrostatic\ninteractions were treated by means of\nthe particle mesh Ewald\n(PME) method. The MD simulation results were further analyzed\nusing Discovery Studio software (version 2.5.5, Accelrys)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"peptide_sequence\": \"FWK\",

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "polypeptide self-assembly literature information extraction"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Change of chirality is a useful tool to manipulate the aqueous self-assembly \nbehaviour of uncapped, hydrophobic tripeptides. In contrast with other short \npeptides, these tripeptides form hydrogels at a physiological pH without the aid \nof organic solvents or end-capping groups (e.g. Fmoc). The novel hydrogel \nforming peptide (D)Leu-Phe-Phe ((D)LFF) and its epimer Leu-Phe-Phe (LFF) \nexemplify dramatic supramolecular effects induced by subtle changes to \nstereochemistry. Only the d-amino acid-containing peptide instantly forms a \nhydrogel in aqueous solution following a pH switch, generating long fibres (>100 \n\u03bcm) that entangle into a 3D network. However, unexpected nanostructures are \nobserved for both peptides and they are particularly heterogeneous for LFF. \nStructural analyses using CD, FT-IR and fluorescent amyloid staining reveal \nanti-parallel beta-sheets for both peptides. XRD analysis also identifies key \ndistances consistent with beta-sheet formation in both peptides, but suggests \nadditional high molecular order and extended molecular length for (D)LFF only. \nMolecular modelling of the two peptides highlights the key interactions \nresponsible for self-assembly; in particular, rapid self-assembly of (D)LFF is \npromoted by a phenylalanine zipper, which is not possible because of steric \nfactors for LFF. In conclusion, this study elucidates for the first time the \nmolecular basis for how chirality can dramatically influence supramolecular \norganisation in very short peptide sequences.\n\nPhe-Wang resin, O-benzotriazole-N,N,N,N0-tetramethyl-uro-\nnium-hexa\ufb02uoro-phosphate (HBTU), and Fmoc protected L-\nleucine were purchased from GL Biochem Ltd. Fmoc-protected\nD-leucine was purchased from Mimotopes. All\npurchased were of analytical grade from Merck. Piperidine, tri-\n\ufb02uoroacetic acid (TFA), diisopropyl ethyl amine (DIPEA), trii-\nsopropyl silane (TIPS) were from Acros. Sodium dihydrogen\nphosphate and disodium hydrogen phosphate were from BDH\nAnalaR. High purity Milli-Q-water (MQ water) with a resistivity\ngreater than 18 MU cm was obtained from an in-line Millipore\nRiOs/Origin system. Silicon wafers (M.M.R.C Pty Ltd.) were\ncleaned by ultrasonication (1 h) in a surfactant solution of 2%\nethanol with 2% RBS 35 (Pierce) followed by rinsing with\ncopious amounts of MQ water and dried with nitrogen, then\ncleaned for 1 h in a UV/ozone Procleaner(cid:2) (Bioforce Nano-\nsciences). 1H-NMR spectra were recorded at 400 MHz, and 13C-\nNMR spectra were recorded at 100 MHz on a Bruker Instrument\nBiospin Av400H. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to\nTMS. Low resolution ESI-MS spectra were acquired with a\nShimadzu LCMS-2010EV mass spectrometer using a cone\nvoltage of 50 V and the source was maintained at 80 (cid:4)C. The\nsolvent used was methanol containing 0.1% formic acid with a\n\ufb02ow rate of 0.1 ml min(cid:3)1.\nThe secondary structure of the peptides was analysed using a\n0.1 cm quartz cell on a Jasco J815 Spectropolarimeter, with 1s\nintegrations, 1 accumulation and a step size of 1 nm with a band\nwidth of 1 nm over a range of wavelengths from 200 to 280 nm.\nPeptide samples freshly prepared in buffer A were diluted with\nbuffer B directly in the CD cell, and the spectra were recorded\nafter 15 min. Measurements were repeated at least 5 times, and to\nreduce the noise near 200 nm, their average was plotted.\nFT-IR spectra were collected on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spec-\ntrometer in ATR mode. Freshly prepared sonicated peptide\nsamples were analysed. Alternatively, they were left to settle and\ngel for 24 h in a glass vial. As no signi\ufb01cant difference was seen in\nthe signal identity between the two time points, spectra at 24 h\nare reported. A portion of the gel was then transferred on a clean\npiece of silicon wafer (1 cm (cid:5) 1 cm), then gently spread by\npressing a coverslip on top, and dried under vacuum for 24 h.\nDried samples on the silicon wafers were placed directly to the\nATR crystal, facing down. Scans were between 1800 and\n1500 cm(cid:3)1 with 80 accumulations at a resolution of 4 cm(cid:3)1.\nBoth peptides were synthesised using standard Fmoc solid phase\npeptide synthesis with HBTU activation, following the same\nprocedure described previously.26 Crude peptides were too\nhydrophobic to be precipitated in cold ether, thus the majority of\nTFA was evaporated under nitrogen \ufb02ow, and the remaining oil\nwas redissolved in a mixture of acetonitrile\u2013water, and then\nDynamic time sweep rheological analysis was conducted on an\n(TA Instruments, USA) with a 25 mm\naluminium parallel plate geometry. A Peltier temperature\ncontroller was connected to the rheometer to maintain a\ntemperature of 25 (cid:4)C. Freshly prepared and sonicated peptide\nsample solutions were either immediately analysed, or left to\nsettle for 24 h. A gap of 300 mm was set. Strain sweeps were\nGel precursor solutions were prepared as indicated above and\n25 ml were immediately placed on wells of a \u2018\u2018m-Slide Angiogen-\nesis\u2019\u2019 uncoated (Ibidi, Germany, through DKSH Australia). 25 ml\nof a solution of Thio\ufb02avin T (200 mM in 50 mM glycine\u2013NaOH\npH 7.5, 0.2 mm \ufb01ltered) were placed on top. After 15 minutes, the\nslides were imaged on a Leica SP5 microscope (63(cid:5) water\nimmersion objective, NA 1.2, excitation 458 nm, emission 468\u2013\n600 nm). Alternatively, gels prepared in glass vials as described\nabove were left to settle, and at later time points (24 h, or up to 7\ndays) were transferred onto the slides, stained and imaged as\ndescribed above. Samples treated and stained with an identical\nprotocol but without the peptide, were used as control and did\nnot reveal any of the \ufb02uorescent structures described in the text\n(data not shown).\nAn Asylum Research MFP-3D atomic force microscope (Santa\nBarbara, CA, USA) was used to measure surface topography in\ntapping mode with ultrasharp silicon nitride tips (NSC15 non-\ncontact silicon cantilevers, MikroMasch, Spain). The tips used in\nthis study had a typical force constant of 40 N m(cid:3)1 and a reso-\nnant frequency of 320 kHz. Typical scan settings involved the use\nof an applied piezo de\ufb02ection voltage of 0.6\u20130.7 V at a scan rate\nof 0.7 Hz. All images were processed (1st order \ufb02attening algo-\nrithm) and linescans were generated using Igor Pro software.\nFreshly prepared and sonicated peptide samples were spread\nonto a clean square of silicon wafer (1 cm (cid:5) 1 cm) by gently\npressing a glass coverslip on top. Samples were then dried in a\nvacuum oven at room temperature for 24 h. Alternatively, freshly\nprepared peptide samples were left to settle and gel for 24 h, or up\nto 3 days, after which a small part of the gel was transferred onto\na clean square piece of silicon wafer and dried as described\nA laboratory-built humidity-controlled vitri\ufb01cation system was\nused to prepare the hydrogels for imaging in a thin layer of\nvitri\ufb01ed ice using cryo-TEM. Humidity was kept close to 80% for\nall experiments, and the ambient temperature was 22 (cid:4)C. 200-\nmesh copper grids coated with a perforated carbon \ufb01lm (Lacey\ncarbon \ufb01lm: ProSciTech, Qld, Australia) were used for all\nexperiments. Grids were glow discharged in nitrogen for 5\nseconds immediately before use. Hydrogels were prepared as\ndescribed above with or without sonication, showing no signi\ufb01-\ncant difference in their structure. They were either analysed\nimmediately after preparation, or at different time points (after\n24 h, or up to 3 days). At the time of analysis, the hydrogels were\ndisrupted by tapping against the glass vial, and samples were\nagitated with the pipette tip in order to liquefy them if possible.\nApproximately 4 ml aliquots of sample were pipetted onto each\ngrid prior to plunging. In the case of samples which could not be\nlique\ufb01ed adequately, the gel was smeared gently onto the grid.\nAfter 30 seconds adsorption time the grid was blotted manually\nusing Whatman 541 \ufb01lter paper, for approximately 6\u201310 seconds.\nBlotting time was optimised for each sample. The grid was then\nplunged into liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen. Frozen\ngrids were stored in liquid nitrogen until required. The samples\nwere examined using a Gatan 626 cryoholder (Gatan, Pleas-\nanton, CA, USA) and a Tecnai 12 Transmission Electron\nMicroscope (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) at an operating\nvoltage of 120 kV. At all times low dose procedures were fol-\nlowed, using an electron dose of 8\u201310 electrons per (cid:1)A2 for all\nimaging. Images were recorded using a Megaview III CCD\ncamera and AnalySIS camera control software (Olympus) using\nmagni\ufb01cations in the range 40 000(cid:5) to 110 000(cid:5).\nCarbon-coated 300-mesh copper grids were glow-discharged in\nnitrogen to render the carbon \ufb01lm hydrophilic. A 4 ml aliquot of\nthe sample was pipetted onto each grid. After 30 seconds\nadsorption time the excess was drawn off using Whatman 541\n\ufb01lter paper, followed by staining with 2% aqueous potassium\nphosphotungstate at pH 7.2, for 10 seconds. Grids were air-dried\nuntil needed. Samples were examined using a Tecnai 12 Trans-\nmission Electron Microscope (FEI, Eindhoven, The Nether-\nlands) at an operating voltage of 120 kV. Images were recorded\nusing a Megaview III CCD camera and AnalySIS camera control\nsoftware (Olympus). Each grid was systematically examined and\nimaged to re\ufb02ect a representative view of the sample. This was\nimportant as samples of this type can be very non-homogeneous\non the grid; they tend not to disperse evenly and the structures\noccur in distinct patches.\nA Bruker D8 Advance X-ray Diffractometer with CuKa radia-\ntion (40 kV, 40 mA) equipped with a LynxEye silicon strip\ndetector was employed to determine the X-ray diffraction (XRD)\npatterns. Each sample was scanned over the 2-theta range from\n1(cid:4) to 60(cid:4) with a step size of 0.02(cid:4) and a count time of 1.6 seconds\nper step. An air scatter slit was used to reduce the beam intensity\nat low angles. Analyses were performed on the collected XRD\ndata for each sample using the Bruker XRD search match\nprogram EVA(cid:2). The samples were mounted on zero back-\nground plates consisting of a silicon wafer located in a standard\nBruker specimen holder, and were dried in air prior to analysis.\nTripeptide structures were constructed in SybylX1.1 and model\nstructures minimised using the AMBER force \ufb01eld, Kollman all\natom charges, and implicit water (dielectric constant of 80). The\nminimisations were carried out by aligning copies of the tripep-\ntides in an anti-parallel alignment with the distances between\nbackbone amides being set to the optimum hydrogen bonding\ndistance (2.7 (cid:1)A). Steric clashes between the terminal Phe and Leu\nmoieties were relieved by rotating the Phe rings away from the\nLeu (L-isomer) or leaving them in an extended conformation (D-\nisomer) with the backbones being set to a beta-sheet conforma-\ntion. The centre Phe rings were aligned parallel to each other to\nmaximise any p\u2013p stacking interactions. The structures gener-\nated this way were then subjected to energy minimisation also"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"peptide_sequence\": \"LFF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"nanosphere\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"100 PBS\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"10.0\", \"PH\": \"7.4\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"5.0\"}, {\"peptide_sequence\": \"lFF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"hydrogel\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"100 PBS\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"10.0\", \"PH\": \"7.4\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"5.0\"}]"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "polypeptide self-assembly literature information extraction"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The self-assembly of peptides into ordered supramolecular structures, such as \nfibrils and crystals, is of relevance in such diverse areas as molecular \nmedicine and materials science. However, little information is available about \nthe fundamental thermodynamic driving forces of these types of self-assembly \nprocesses. Here, we investigate in detail the thermodynamics of assembly of \ndiphenylalanine (FF). This dipeptide forms the central motif of the A\u03b2 peptides, \nwhich are associated with Alzheimer's disease through their presence in amyloid \nplaques in the nervous systems of affected individuals. We identify the \nmolecular origins of the self-assembly of FF in aqueous solution, and we \nevaluate these findings in the context of the aggregation free energies of \nlonger peptides that are able to form amyloid fibrils. We find that the \nthermodynamics of FF assembly displays the typical characteristics of \nhydrophobic desolvation processes, and detailed analysis of the temperature \ndependence of the kinetics of assembly within the framework of crystallization \ntheories reveals that the transition state from solution to crystalline \naggregates is enthalpically unfavorable and entropically favorable, \nqualitatively similar to what has been found for longer sequences. This \nquantitative comparison of aggregating peptides of very different lengths is the \nbasis of an in-depth understanding of the relationship between sequence and \nassembly behavior.\n\nReagents and Solutions. Solutions of FF were prepared by the\nsuspension of diphenylalanine (Bachem, Basel, Switzerland) in\ndistilled water (18.2 \u03a9/m) followed by ultrasonication in a sonic\nbath until the suspension was homogeneous and heating to 80\u2212100\n\u00b0C. Following 30 min at \u223c100 \u00b0C, no visible aggregates were\nobservable for concentrations up to and including 4.5 g/L (14.5 mM).\nSeed solutions\nfor growth experiments were prepared by the\nsonication (via ultrasonic bath) at room temperature of 2 g/L water\nsolutions that had been allowed to aggregate and left standing for at\nleast 1 day.\nFF was used as received without further puri\ufb01cation, while the\nsample of GF as obtained required further puri\ufb01cation. A solution of\ncrude GF was prepared from 692 mg GF (PeptaNova, Sandhausen,\nGermany) and 13 mL of distilled water at 100 \u00b0C. On cooling, GF\nprecipitated as \ufb01ne, needle-like crystals with a habit similar to FF (yield\n312 mg). These crystals were removed from the mother liquor by\nConcentration Measurements. The dipeptide concentrations\nwere determined by UV spectrophotometry using a Cary 400\ninstrument version 8.01. Spectra were recorded\nspectrophotometer,\nbetween 300 and 230 nanometres with a reading every 0.4 nm.\nSpectral bandwidth was 2 nm. The spectrophotometer was \ufb01tted with\na variable temperature stage (Peltier thermocouple system). Glass\ncuvettes of path length 2 mm or 4 mm were used depending on the\nvolume of solution available for the test. Concentration was taken to\nbe proportional to the absorption value at 258 nm, using a molar\nabsorption coe\ufb03cient of 390 M\u22121 cm\u22121, calculated from the molar\nabsorption coe\ufb03cient of phenylalanine. The change in peak\nabsorbance with temperature was found by heating a solution of 0.5\ng/L concentration from 4 to 70 \u00b0C, and this was used to correct\nreadings at each temperature.\nFrom repeated preparations of FF solutions from as-received\nlysophilized peptide of di\ufb00erent batches, we found that FF\nconcentrations (as determined from the absorption at 258 nm) were\nreproducibly ca. 25% lower than predicted from weighing the peptide.6\nThe majority, but not all, of this di\ufb00erence can be attributed to the\nwater content of the received peptide, as determined by thermogravi-\nmetric analysis (data not shown). Therefore, unlike previous studies,6\nin the present study we relied entirely on the UV absorption\nmeasurements.\nTo investigate potential subcritical association in water and hence\nthe validity of the crystallization model (which assumes no long-lived\nassociation below the critical concentration, and nucleation-dependent\nassociation thereafter), solutions at concentrations 0.10\u22121.00 g/L\nwere prepared by dilution of 1.00 g/L stock. These were allowed to\nstand for 1 h, and then ultracentrifuged for 1 h at 62 000g. The\nabsorption above zero (set at 300 nm) at 258 nm was plotted against\nconcentration.\nTo ascertain critical concentrations (solubility) as a function of\ntemperature, quantities of FF at a range of concentrations were\nprepared and allowed to equilibrate slowly in quiescent conditions to\nroom temperature and then held at 4 \u00b0C overnight in the presence of a\nnumber of macroscopic crystals. The temperature controlled stage of\nthe spectrophotometer was set to the starting temperature (either 4 or\n8 \u00b0C) and the program \u201cWavelength Scans at Temperature\nIncrements\u201d, from the Agilent Web site, was used to record a series\nof spectra between 230 and 300 nm following stirring for 80 min at a\nnumber of temperatures between 8 and 68 \u00b0C. The uncertainty in the\nFF concentrations, \u0394cs, was determined from repeated measurements.\nFrom the uncertainties in the concentration measurements at di\ufb00erent\ntemperatures, we determined the uncertainty in the enthalpy of\ncrystallization, \u0394\u0394H, by using the van\u2019t Ho\ufb00 equation, according to\n. The error in the entropy of crystallization was\nthe growth\nkinetics of the FF crystals were carried out as described previously,14\nthat here the measurements were performed at di\ufb00erent\ntemperatures. The \ufb02ow reactors were micro\ufb02uidic devices constructed\nfrom polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS):58,59 a 25 \u03bcm thick layer of SU-8\n3025 photoresist was spin-coated onto a silicon wafer, exposed to UV-\nlight through a mask in which the device design was printed, then\nmanufactured in 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate (PGMEA). The micro-\n\ufb02uidic device was fabricated from Sylgard 184 PDMS elastomer\n(DowCorning, Midland, MI), using 1 h curing at 65 \u00b0C. After cutting\nthe device, punching the holes for inlets and outlets, and activation via\nplasma treatment with a Femto plasma bonder (Diener Electronic,\nEbhausen, Germany), the micro\ufb02uidic device was bonded to a 3 \u00d7 1\nin. microscope slide. A suspension of seed crystals was passed through\nthe device, and once su\ufb03cient crystals had settled in the central\nchamber, a \ufb02ow of FF solution was initiated at a rate of 800 \u03bcL/h,\ncorresponding to velocities on the order of millimeters per second in\nthe channel center, by means of a NemeSys syringe pump (Cetoni,\nKorbussen, Germany). Temperature was controlled using a micro-\nscope heating stage. Measurements of lengths of growing microcrystals\nwere made every 5 s using time lapse photography, using a Zeiss Axio\nObserver A1 microscope (Carl Zeiss,\nJena, Germany) and a\nCoolSNAP-MYO camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). The axial\ngrowth rates were computed as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation of the\n\ufb01ve fastest growing structures.14 We measured the axial growth rates at\na FF concentration of 1.2 g/L at di\ufb00erent temperatures (22, 28, 38, 44,\nand 48 \u00b0C), and used the data on the temperature dependence of the\ncritical concentration to correct for the fact that the driving force for\naggregate growth decreases at higher temperatures (see the Supporting\nInformation for details of the analysis).\nDynamic Light Scattering. DLS experiments were performed\nwith a Zetasizer ZSP Instrument (Malvern, UK), using a scattering\nangle of 173\u00b0 (forward scattering). Concentrated stock solutions were\nprepared at elevated temperatures, and then the solutions were passed\nthrough a 220 nm pore size syringe \ufb01lter and measured in disposable\nsmall volume sizing cuvettes at di\ufb00erent temperatures and dilution\nfactors. The data were plotted as size distributions weighted by\nscattering intensity."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"peptide_sequence\": \"FF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"tube\",

(Shanghai, China). Titani-\num diisopropoxide bis(acetyl-acetonate) (TDA, 75 % in isopropanol)\nwas purchased from Tokyo Chemicals Industry. Tris(hydroxymethyl)\naminomethane was purchased from Alfa Aesar. (Beijing, China).\nThe TiO2 nanofibers can be synthesized by using Fmoc-FFD as the\ntemplate. Typically, lyophilized Fmoc-FFD powder (25.988 mg) was\ndissolved in ultra-pure H2O (5 mL) at a concentration of 8 mm. The\npH of the peptide solution was adjusted by the addition of appro-\npriate amounts of 0.5 m Tris buffer or 0.5 m HCl with stirring at\nroom temperature (25 8C). After the mixture had been stirred for\n30 min, TDA (75 % in isopropanol, 145.75 mL) was added to the\nmixture with stirring at 55 8C. Then, the mixture was allowed to\nreact at 55 8C with stirring for 2 h. The products were dried by\nfreeze drying. All organics were then removed by calcination at\n550 8C for 6 h.\nThe pure TiO2 was synthesized without using the peptide as tem-\nplate. The TDA (75 % in isopropanol, 145.75 mL) was added to ultra-\npure H2O (5 mL) with stirring at 55 8C. The mixture was allowed to\nreact at 55 8C with stirring for 2 h.

Then, the dried products were calcined at 550 8C for\nPhotocatalytic degradation of MO by the TiO2 nanofibers\nsynthesized by using Fmoc-FFD peptide as a template\nMethyl orange (MO) was selected to investigate the photocatalytic\nactivity of the as-synthesized TiO2 nanofibers. First, TiO2 nanofiber\nphotocatalyst (10 mg) was suspended in MO solution (10 mL of\n10 mg L@1). In the dark, the solution was sonicated for 5 min and\nstirred for 30 min to establish the adsorption and desorption equi-\nlibrium. Then, a 16.7 A lamp was used to irradiate the solutions. A\nUV/Vis spectrophotometer (TV-1810, Beijing PERSEE) was used to\nmeasure the content of the remaining MO by taking out a small\namount of sample every hour. The degradation rate of MO was cal-\nculated from the absorption peak at 464 nm. As a control experi-\nment, pure TiO2 was used to degrade MO under the same condi-\ntions. The experiments were repeated three times for each synthe-\nsized TiO2 catalyst in the photocatalytic degradation.\nThe morphologies of the TiO2 nanofibers were examined by SEM\n(Hitachi High-Technologies Co., Japan) with an acceleration voltage\nof 3 kV. The TEM images were recorded with a JEOL 1200EX elec-\ntron microscope operating at 80 kV. Powder X-ray diffraction\n(PXRD) patterns were recorded with a PANalytical/X\u2019Pert PRO MPD\nsystem with CuKa radiation (l = 1.5406 a). The CD measurements\nwere collected by using a J-810 circular dichroism spectrophotom-\neter (JASCO, Japan) with 0.1 mm path length quartz cuvettes.\nMolecular dynamics simulations (MDs) were performed by using\nthe Gromacs program[23] under the Amber99SB-ILDN force field.[24]\nThe initial structure of Fmoc-FFD was constructed by using Accel-\nrys Materials Studio 2.5 software. Models were placed in an ortho-\nrhombic periodic boundary condition (PBC) box with a margin of\n2 nm, filled with TIP3P water molecules. The system was electrically\nneutralized by adding extra Na + ions. The 5000 steepest descent\nsteps and 5000 conjugate gradient minimization steps were per-\nformed to minimize the energy of system. Then, a 1 ns restraint\nsimulation at a time step of 1 fs was performed in the NPT ensem-\nble to make water molecules relax, followed by production simula-\ntion of 40 ns in the NPT ensemble at a temperature of 300 K. The\nParticle Mesh Ewald (PME) method[25] was used to calculate non-\nbonded and long-range electrostatic interactions with a cut-off\nvalue of 1.0 nm.
