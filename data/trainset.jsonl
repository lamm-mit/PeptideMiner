To image the internal structure of\nhydrogel, morphological studies were conducted with \ufb01eld\nemission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and high-\nresolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The\nFE-SEM and HR-TEM images (Figure 2) revealed a dense\nFigure 2.

The TEM images show that the width\nof the \ufb01bers varies between 25 and 45 nm while in the SEM\nimages this range is 50\u221290 nm. The di\ufb00erence in diameter of\nthe nano\ufb01bers obtained from the two di\ufb00erent microscopic\ntechniques is due to the di\ufb00erence in sample preparation used\nthese two techniques (FE-SEM and HR-TEM). Self-\nassembled peptide \ufb01bers are several micrometers in length. The\nentangled \ufb01brilar network provides a cage-like environment\nwhere small water molecules can entrap to give a self-\nsupporting hydrogel. The three-dimensional network also\no\ufb00ers enough room for entrapment of relatively large drug\nFT-IR Study. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-\nIR) of the xerogel reveals a hydrogen-bonded supramolecular\nnetwork within the hydrogel. Signi\ufb01cant peaks were obtained at\n3371, 1688, 1639, and 1535 cm\u22121 in the FTIR spectrum\n(Figure S6). The peak at 3371 cm\u22121 indicates a hydrogen-\nbonded N\u2212H stretching while the peaks at 1639 and 1535\ncm\u22121 are signature peaks for C\ue0c8O stretching (amide I) and\nN\u2212H bending (amide II), respectively. A sharp peak at 1688\ncm\u22121 clearly suggests the presence of an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet\narrangement of the gelator peptide molecules within the gel\nphase material.13\nX-ray Di\ufb00raction Studies. To gain insight about\nmolecular arrangement within the supramolecular network\nstructure, SAXS on gels and wide-angle powder XRD of the\nxerogel were carried out. From the small-angle X-ray scattering\nit appears that the\n(SAXS) measurements for the wet gel,\nlength of a single molecule in the self-assembled structure is\nabout 31 \u00c5 (D) (Figure S7). Taking this into consideration, in\nthe wide-angle XRD pattern periodic peaks at 5.25 \u00c5 (2\u03b8 =\n16.86\u00b0), 4.61 \u00c5 (2\u03b8 = 19.23\u00b0), 3.88 \u00c5 (2\u03b8 = 22.90\u00b0), and 3.34\n\u00c5 (2\u03b8 = 26.65\u00b0) can be assigned as D/6, D/7, D/8, and D/9,\nrespectively (Table 1 and Figure 3). This result indicates a\nmolecules (Table 1 and Figure 3). In this study, d = 4.92 \u00c5\nis the distance between the peptide chains within a \u03b2-sheet,\nwhile the d spacing of 8.44 \u00c5 can be characterized as the\ndistance between two stacked \u03b2-sheets.13 Another peak at d =\n3.76 \u00c5 signi\ufb01es the \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 interaction between the phenyl rings of\nthe molecules in the three-dimensional network structure\n(Figure 3).56 Combining these results obtained from X-ray\ndi\ufb00raction and FT-IR analyses, it can be concluded that the\ngelator peptide molecules are self-assembled in the gel state to\nform a \u03b2-sheet-like structure. A probable mechanistic model is\nshown in Figure S8. This indicates the various noncovalent\ninteractions involved in the self-assembled gel state material.\nFluorescence Spectroscopic Study for \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 Interac-\ntion. Fluorescence spectroscopy is a very useful tool to know\nthe existence of \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 interactions within the self-assembled\nmolecules.57,58 To carry out this study, eight solutions were\ntaken in phosphate bu\ufb00er (pH 7.46), where the gelator\nconcentration was varied from 0.0005% (w/v) to 0.1% (w/v).\nFluorescence emission spectra of these solutions were recorded\nwith excitation at 261 nm (Figure S9). A new broad peak\nbegins to develop around 358 nm, when the concentration is\nincreased from 0.0025% (w/v) to 0.005% (w/v), and this peak\ngradually becomes signi\ufb01cant as the concentration increases up\nto 0.1% (w/v). This new peak at 358 nm arise from the \u03c0\u2212\u03c0\ninteraction.59,60 This indicates the presence of a strong aromatic\ninteraction between the phenyl\nside chain moieties of\nphenylalanine residues in these interacting gelator molecules.\nthe Thixotropic Property. A glass vial\ncontaining 5 mg of P1 was taken and dissolved in 1 mL of\nphosphate bu\ufb00er having pH 7.46, and it was left standing for a\nfew minutes. The gel thus formed was shaken vigorously by\nhand to obtain a clear solution. This solution was then allowed\nto rest, and a self-supportive gel was regained within 40 min\n(Figure 4). This thixotropic property of the peptide hydrogel\ncan be utilized for injectable purpose with an application in\ndrug delivery system (Figure 5).\ninvestigations were carried out to\ngain knowledge about the mechanical strength of the hydrogel\nas well as to check whether the thixotropic nature observed\nwith naked eye can be explained through analytical measure-\nments. At \ufb01rst a frequency sweep experiment (Figure 6) was\ndone with a 0.8% (w/v) hydrogel, where the storage modulus\n(G\u2032) and loss modulus (G\u2033) were measured as a function of\nangular frequency keeping strain constant at 0.1%. In the low-\nfrequency region (6\u2212100 rad/s) the G\u2032 and G\u2033 values are only\nweakly dependent on frequency, indicating formation of a good\nstable gel.\nA continuous strain time dependent study of the hydrogel\nwas then performed by using 0.5% (w/v) hydrogel, and it was\nsubjected to a continuous strain increased from 0.1% to 50% to\nrupture the gel matrix. Then its restoration phenomenon was\nrecorded with time under a constant strain of 0.1%. During\nlamellar arrangement of\nthe molecules within the self-\nassembled network structure.54,55 Moreover, the peaks at d\nvalues of 4.92 \u00c5 (2\u03b8 = 18.00\u00b0) and 8.44 \u00c5 (2\u03b8 = 10.47\u00b0) are\nindicative of a \u03b2-sheet-like arrangement of\nthese gelator\nFigure 5. Illustration of the injectable nature of the hydrogel and its vitamin release phenomenon with vitamin B12.\nFigure 6. Frequency sweep rheological analysis of the hydrogel [(0.8%\n(w/v)] at a constant strain of 0.1%.\napplication of continuous strain the G\u2032 line gradually goes\nbelow the G\u2033 line to con\ufb01rm the transformation of the gel to a\nsol like material, and then with re-establishment of gel strength\nafter cessation of high applied strain the G\u2032 line again moves\nover G\u2033. The process is repeated over three cycles to verify its\nreproducibility (Figure S10).\nThe frequency sweep experiment and step strain experiment\nat 0.5% w/v have also been given in Figure S11 and Figure S12,\nrespectively.\nThough the thixotropic property of the hydrogel can be\nnicely explained from the previous experiment, the injectable\nnature of a gel-like material can be best con\ufb01rmed through a\ntime dependent step-strain rheological experiment.35,61\u221263 In\nthis process the 0.8% (w/v) gel was \ufb01rst kept under low\nconstant strain of 0.1% for the \ufb01rst 200 s, and then it was\nsuddenly subjected to a higher strain of 40%; at this point G\u2033\nvalues greater than the corresponding G\u2032 values were observed.\nAfter that, the strain was suddenly decreased and \ufb01xed to a\nconstant low strain of 0.1% (same as \ufb01rst interval), and from\nthis point (400 s) the restoration of gel strength was observed\n(Figure 7). It is evident from Figure 7 that the hydrogel takes\nabout 360 s after the withdrawal of the large strain to almost\nfor G\u2032 value to retain its\nrecover its original strength,\nlow strain of 0.1%. All\noriginal value, under a constant\nFigure 7. Step-strain time dependent rheological analysis of\nhydrogel [(0.8% (w/v)] at a \ufb01xed angular frequency of 1 rad/s.\nrheological experiments were performed at a constant temper-\nature of 25 \u00b0C. The recovery of the original gel strength is\ncrucial for injectable applications. In real situations, the three\nintervals of this experiment are analogous to (i) a viscoelastic\nmaterial within a syringe, (ii) the material within the needle of\nthe syringe, and (iii) after its injection into a target system.\nTo check whether the gel-sol transformation occurs just on\nmechanical shaking by hand, the frequency sweep experiment\nhas been performed both in gel state and in the sol state after\nmechanical shaking of the 0.8% w/v gel at a \ufb01xed strain of 15%.\nIn the case of gel, G\u2032 > G\u2033 in our studied frequency region\n(0.5\u22126 rad/s). However, after mechanical shaking of the gel, it\nis transformed into a low viscous liquid, and G\u2032 < G\u2033 in the low\nand our studied frequency region (0.5\u22126 rad/s). This study\nclearly indicates the breaking of\nthe gel upon mechanical\nshaking and the transformation of the gel phase material to a\nlow viscous liquid/solution (Figure S13).\nSustained Drug Release from the Injectable Gel. The\npeptide P1 forms a hydrogel at physiological pH (7.46) and\ntemperature (37 \u00b0C). The nano\ufb01brillar network structure\nwithin the hydrogel has many void spaces as it is evident from\nFE-SEM and HR-TEM images, and it provides a cage-like\nenvironment that can act as a template for the entrapment and\nrelease of small drug molecules. The supramolecular three-\ndimensional \ufb01brous network structures within the hydrogel,\ncon\ufb01rmed from FE-SEM and HR-TEM images, provides a\ncage-like environment, and this can work as a template for the\nentrapment and release of small drug molecules. Vitamin B12\nand vancomycin are the two biomolecules which were used in\nthe present study to observe their release kinetics from the\nhydrogel. Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) plays a very important\nrole in normal functioning of nerves and brain and for the\nformation of blood.14 On the other hand, vancomycin is an\nantibiotic used in the treatment of infections caused by Gram-\npositive bacteria like penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.63\nIt is interesting to observe the release of these two biologically\nimportant molecules from the peptide-based hydrogel at\nphysiological pH and temperature (37 \u00b0C and pH 7.46). In\nthis regard, two 1 mL gels having the same concentration of\n0.8% (w/v) were prepared and loaded with vitamin B12\n(hydrogel 1) and vancomycin (hydrogel 2) separately. These\ngels (1 mL each) were encapsulated with 1.14 mg of vitamin\nB12 and 0.24 mg of vancomycin separately. The loaded\nhydrogels were covered with phosphate bu\ufb00er over the gels\nand kept at 37 \u00b0C in an incubator. The gradual enhancement of\ncolor intensity of the bu\ufb00er layer and subsequent decrease in\ncolor intensity of the gel layer were observed for the vitamin B12\ncontaining hydrogel (Figure 5). However, this observation was\nmissing from the other hydrogel as the vancomycin solution is\ncolorless. For the kinetic study, small aliquots of the bu\ufb00er\nsolution were taken from time to time, and their UV/vis spectra\nwere recorded to note the absorbance values at 550 nm for\nvitamin B12 and 280 nm for vancomycin. The absorbance data\nof aliquots from hydrogel 1 (the hydrogel containing only\nvitamin B12) and hydrogel 2 (the hydrogel containing only\nvancomycin) were taken at the same time up to 47 h. The\nentire process was repeated \ufb01ve times for each sample, and a\npercentage release pro\ufb01le of drugs with error bars is obtained\nFigure 8. Percentage release plot of some important biomolecules\nfrom the hydrogel at physiological pH (7.46) and temperature (37\n\u00b0C), where concentration of the drugs loaded in the hydrogel was 1.14\nmg/mL for cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) and 0.24 mg/mL for\nvancomycin.\nwhere Mt, M\u221e, and \u03bb are the total amount of drug released\nduring the measurement, the total amount of drug that was\nkept within the gel matrix, and hydrogel thickness, respectively.\nThe time of measurement (in seconds) and the di\ufb00usion\nconstant of the drug molecule are represented by t and D,\nrespectively. The drug loaded hydrogels in glass vials remained\nstable in the presence of bu\ufb00er for about 47 h for both hydrogel\n1 and hydrogel 2 under physiological pH and temperature. It\nhas been observed that about 90% and 80% drug have been\nreleased from the hydrogels 1 and 2, respectively, before these\ngels start to break and start to di\ufb00use into the respective bu\ufb00er\nlayers. The calculated di\ufb00usion constants for hydrogels 1 and 2\nare 9.47 \u00d7 10\u221211 and 7.48 \u00d7 10\u221211 m2 s\u22121, respectively. This\nslow and sustained release of crucial biomolecules from\nhydrogels existing in physiological conditions holds future\npromise for wide applications in drug delivery systems.\nThe practical applicability of this type of hydrogel formed in\nphysiologically friendly environment lies in the point whether\nthey are injectable or not. Injectable hydrogels can be delivered\nto a target in vivo via a simple syringe without taking the pain of\nsurgical treatment. A simple demonstration of the injectable\nnature of the vitamin B12 loaded hydrogel formed from P1 is\nshown in Figure 5.\nInhibition of cancer cells (breast\ncancer cell line, MCF7) proliferation was evaluated by the 3-\n(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide\n(MTT) reduction.64 MCF-7 cells were seeded at a density of\n10 000 cells per well in a 96-well plate for 18\u221224 h before\ntreatment with the hydrogelator. Then cells were treated with\nvarious concentrations of the compound (stock concentration\nwas 10 mM in autoclaved water) in DMEM medium containing\n10% fetal bovine serum for 24h in 96-well plate (Figure 9).\nFollowing the termination of the experiment, cells were washed\nand promptly assayed for viability using MTT. Results were\nexpressed as percent viability = [A550 (treated cells) \u2212\nbackground/A550 (untreated cells) \u2212 background] \u00d7 100.\nStudy of the Change in the Cellular Morphology after\nthe Compound Treatment. Change in the cellular\nmorphology of MCF-7 cells after the compound treatment\nwas evaluated by following method. MCF-7 cells were seeded at\na density of 50 000 cells per well in a 6-well plate for 18\u221224 h\nbefore the compound treatment. Then the cells were treated\nwith 0.025, 0.05, and 5 mM concentration of compound (stock\nconcentration was 10 mM in autoclaved water) in DMEM\nmedium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h in di\ufb00erent\n6-well plate. Following the termination of the experiment, the\nmorphologies of\nthe cells were observed in the inverted\nmicroscope (Model Nikon Eclipse Ti-U) in DIC mode.\nDose-dependent MTT assay with varying

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "polypeptide self-assembly literature information extraction"}, {"role": "user", "content": "We demonstrate an effective strategy to prepare highly stable nanoemulsions \nusing ferrocene-modified tripeptides. Compared with traditional nanoemulsions, \nbioorganometallic peptide nanoemulsions are appealing for a number of reasons, \nincluding long-term and outstanding thermal stability, redox activity and \nbiocompatibility. The formed nanoemulsions could remain stable for more than \nfour months at room temperature, which is the highest stability reported so far \nfor peptide and protein emulsifiers. The phase behaviour and size distribution \nof the emulsions could be precisely tailored by altering the temperature, \nsolvent ratio and redox state of the ferrocene moiety. In this process, we \nobserved a unique enthalpy-driven phase transition from nanoemulsions to \nhydrogels, which could be attributed to the competition between the interfacial \nfree energy and the association energy among the self-assembling peptides. \nMoreover, we could impart catalytic activity to the nanoemulsions through \nrationally altering the sequence of the tripeptides. The structurally tunable, \nfunctional bioorganometallic nanoemulsions offer new opportunities in many areas \nincluding drug delivery, and the food and cosmetic industries.\n\nFerrocene-L-Phe-L-Phe-L-His (Fc-FFH, 98% in purity), ferrocene-L-\nPhe-L-Phe-L-Asp (Fc-FFD, 98% in purity), ferrocene-L-Phe-L-Phe-L-\nPhe (Fc-FFF, 98% in purity), and ferrocene-L-Phe-L-Phe-L-Ser (Fc-\nFFS, 98% in purity) were synthesized by GL Biochem Ltd\n(China). All other chemicals were of analytical grade, which\nwere obtained from commercial sources. Phosphate bu\ufb00er\n(50 mM, pH 7.20) was prepared by mixing a certain volume of\n50 mM NaH2PO4 solution (prepared by dissolving 600 mg\nNaH2PO4 in 100 mL water) and 50 mM Na2HPO4 solution (pre-\npared by dissolving 1.79 g Na2HPO4\u00b712 H2O in 100 mL water).\nPreparation of nanoemulsions. In a typical experiment, 1 mg\nFc-FFH (Fc-FFD, Fc-FFF, and Fc-FFS) was first dissolved in\n50 mM pH 7.20 phosphate bu\ufb00er at 60 \u00b0C, then di\ufb00erent\nvolumes of ethyl acetate were added into Fc-FFH (Fc-FFD, Fc-\nFFF, and Fc-FFS) bu\ufb00er solution (the volume ratio of phos-\nphate bu\ufb00er to ethyl acetate was altered from 1 : 9, 3 : 7, 5 : 5,\n7 : 3, to 9 : 1, and the total volume was always 1 mL) at room\ntemperature. The mixtures were homogenized for 30 s, leading\nstable nanoemulsions at di\ufb00erent\nto the formation of\naqueous/organic volume ratios.\nPreparation of hydrogels. Fc-FFH nanoemulsions were firstly\nprepared as described above. The nanoemulsions were incu-\nbated at temperatures below 25 \u00b0C without any disturbance,\nleading to the formation of self-supporting hydrogels.\nDetermination of Fc-FFH monomers\u2019 concentration during\nthe phase transition. In the experiment, we used D2O to\nprepare pH 7.20 phosphate bu\ufb00er. Then the Fc-FFH nanoe-\nmulsions and hydrogels were prepared as described above.\nThe two kinds of samples were tested by nuclear magnetic res-\nonance (NMR) analysis. The characteristic peaks of D2O and\nFc could be integrated, and the ratio corresponded to the\nmonomers\u2019 concentration in two phases.\nElectrochemistry oxidation experiment. Electrochemical oxi-\ndation of Fc-FFH nanoemulsions prepared in 7 : 3 aqueous/\norganic volume ratio was conducted at room temperature\nusing an LK2005A electrochemical workstation (LANLIKE,\nChina). The amperometric i\u2013t curve was measured under a\nnitrogen atmosphere, and a three-electrode cell was used to\nmaintain a constant potential of 500 mV between the working\nelectrode and reference electrode. A platinum plate electrode,\na platinum wire electrode, and an Hg/Hg2Cl2 electrode were\nused respectively as the working, counter and reference electro-\ndes, and 50 mM pH 7.20 phosphate bu\ufb00er was used as the\nsupporting electrolyte. The progress of oxidation was followed\nby monitoring the current.\nCatalytic experiment. Fc-FFH nanoemulsions as catalysts\nwere prepared at a 7 : 3 aqueous/organic volume ratio as\ndescribed above. 10 mM p-NPB was mixed with 850 \u03bcL nanoe-\nmulsions, 122.5 \u03bcL 50 mM phosphate bu\ufb00er, and 17.5 \u03bcL\nacetonitrile. The mixture solution was homogenized for 30 s\nand then added into a quartz cuvette. The production of p-NP\nwas determined based on the absorbance at 400 nm. In\naddition, at the end of each catalytic reaction, the nanoemul-\nsions were recycled simply by injecting another equivalent of\nPNPB to the next batch.\nScanning electron microscopy. 10 \u03bcL of prepared nanoemul-\nsions and a slice of hydrogel were deposited neatly on a micro-\nscope glass coverslip and dried in air. All samples were\nsputter-coated with platinum using an E1045 Pt-coater\n(Hitachi High-technologies CO., Japan), and then imaged with\nan S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM,\nHitachi High-technologies CO.,\nJapan) at an acceleration\nvoltage of 3 keV.\nTransmission electron microscopy. The morphology of the\ntripeptide assemblies was further assessed using a JEOL 100CX-II\ntransmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL Ltd, Japan) oper-\nated at 80 keV. To prepare samples, a 10 \u03bcL aliquot of nanoemul-\nsions was placed onto a 200 mesh carbon-coated copper grid,\nand air dried. And for hydrogels, the sample was dispersed in\nddH2O, and 10 \u03bcL aliquot of aqueous dispersion was placed onto\na 200 mesh carbon-coated copper grid, and air dried.\nDynamic light scattering. The nanoemulsions prepared as\ndescribed above were diluted in ddH2O and left to stand\nwithout any disturbance at 20 \u00b0C, 25 \u00b0C, 30 \u00b0C, 40 \u00b0C, 50 \u00b0C,\n60 \u00b0C, and 70 \u00b0C. The size distribution of the samples was\nmeasured using a Zetasizer Nano AS (Malvern Instruments,\nBritish) at the given temperature.\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The as-prepared\nnanoemulsions and hydrogels were frozen at \u221245 \u00b0C and sub-\nsequently dried under vacuum. The spectra of samples were\nrecorded on a Nicolet-560 FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet Co.,\nUSA) with a KBr pellet method across\nthe range of\n\u22121. A total of 16 scans were accumulated with a\n400\u20134000 cm\nresolution of 4 cm\nDi\ufb00erential scanning calorimetry. Thermal analysis of Fc-\nFFH nanoemulsions prepared in the 7 : 3 aqueous/organic\nvolume ratio was performed by di\ufb00erential scanning calorime-\ntry (DSC 1/500, Mettler Toledo, Switzerland), under the protec-\ntion of a nitrogen atmosphere at constant temperatures of 5,\n10 and 15 \u00b0C. The sample cell was filled with 20 \u03bcL Fc-FFH\nnanoemulsions. The sample should be prepared immediately\nprior to its introduction into the instrument. The area of the\nexothermic peak was integrated to yield the enthalpy of the\nphase transition from nanoemulsions to hydrogels."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"peptide_sequence\": \"FFH\",

Thus,\nin this work we demonstrate the use of ultrasound to trigger\nthe self-assembly and alignment of tripeptide nanostructures\nresulting in thermodynamically stable anisotropic organo- and\nhydrogels (Scheme 1).\nThe D\u2013L\u2013L stereochemistry in tripeptides was previously shown\nto give rise to self-supporting hydrogels by Hartley\u2019s group6\nwithout the need for modification with aromatic1a or aliphatic1b\ngroups normally required for short peptide gelation. Here, we use\ntripeptides DFFD (D-phenylalanine\u2013L-phenylalanine\u2013L-aspartic\nacid) and DFFI (D-phenylalanine\u2013L-phenylalanine\u2013L-isoleucine),\nwhich could form gel-phase materials in methanol and aqueous\nsolution triggered by ultrasonic effect, respectively. Tripeptides\nwere synthesized by using the standard Fmoc (fluorenylmethyloxy-\ncarbonyl)\u2013tBu strategy (for details on synthesis, see Experimental\nsection). 10 mg of DFFD was fully dissolved in 1 ml methanol\n(25 mM) by heating up to 50 1C. After cooling down to room\ntemperature, a precipitate was observed (Fig. 1a). The solubility\nof DFFD in methanol determined by UV-Vis spectroscopy is\n20 mM. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show\nthat the precipitate consists of random, short and curved nano-\nfibres (Fig. 1a). For the ultrasonic experiments, we used a purpose-\nbuilt setup, consisting of a glass beaker with a piezo-transducer\n(a) Chemical structures of tri-peptide derivatives of DFFI and\nDFFD.

As Fig. 2a shows, a CD and LD\nsilent spectrum can be obtained for DFFD before ultrasound.\nRemarkably, sound waves induced supramolecular chirality by\nsignificantly enhancing the peaks at 240 and 270 nm in the\norganogel, which may be attributed to the supramolecular\norganization of chiral centers within p\u2013p stacking of phenyl-\nalanines.6a,7 LD spectra show that a minimum at 205 nm and\na maximum at 255 nm are observed which indicates both\nperpendicular and parallel orientation of phenyl moieties to\nthe axis exist in self-assembled structures (Fig. 2b).8\nInfrared spectroscopy in the amide I region of the spectrum\n(1600\u20131700 cm(cid:2)1) was used to determine the hydrogen bonding\nnetworks within the fibrous structures. Spectra of the samples\nwith and without ultrasound treatment are displayed in Fig. 2c.\nThe suspended precipitate of DFFD exhibits a weak, broad peak\naround 1680 cm(cid:2)1, suggesting the presence of unstructured or\nsolvated amide groups. Notably, a strong redshift of the amide\nabsorption around 1650 cm(cid:2)1 was observed upon ultrasound\nexposure, together with a second peak around 1694 cm(cid:2)1.

The\nstorage modulus (G0) exceeds the loss modulus (G00) by factor of 12\ndemonstrating that the tripeptides formed viscoelastic gels. Overall,\nthese results revealed that the size transition of peptide self-\nassembled structures from nano- to micron scale was acousti-\ncally induced, where supramolecular chirality and orientation\nof peptide microtubes and hydrogen bonding interactions were\ndramatically enhanced (Scheme 1).\nIn water, gelation was not observed for DFFD, most likely\ndue to the hydrophilicity of charged aspartic acid. The peptide\nsequence was therefore adapted to increase the hydrophobicity.\nBy changing aspartic acid (DFFD) to more hydrophobic isoleucine\n(DFFI), the ultrasonic alignment can be used to fabricate aniso-\ntropic hydrogels, indicating that the anisotropic arrangement\nof supramolecular interactions is highly related to the peptide\nsequences and solvent environment. 12.5 mg of DFFI was\ndissolved in 1 ml phosphate bu\ufb00er solution (pH 8) (30 mM).\nThe solubility was enhanced by heating up to 80 1C. After\ncooling down to room temperature, a precipitate consisting of\nentangled short nanofibers was observed (Fig. 3a). The solubility\nof DFFI in bu\ufb00er solution determined by UV-Vis spectroscopy is\n15.5 mM. When in situ ultrasound treatment was introduced to\nthe DFFI bu\ufb00er solution for 30 seconds during the cooling\nprocess, a hydrogel was obtained. TEM images show that the\nself-assembled peptide structure changes to bundles of highly\noriented microfibers (Fig. 3b). SEM images indicate that the\nmacroscopic alignment of peptide fibers up to 1 mm of thickness\nand 100 mm of length are achieved (Fig. 3c). Two-photon micro-\nscopy image showed the formation of micro-structure of DFFI in\nthe gel-phase (Fig. 3d).\nTo acquire more insights at the supramolecular level in the\naqueous media, the samples were characterized by spectro-\nscopic methods. Significant enhancement of CD and LD signal\nat 215 nm revealed the presence of chiral centers within b-sheet\ntype arrangement and perpendicular orientation of phenyl\nmoieties to the axis in self-assembled structures after ultrasonic\nexposure (Fig. 4a and b). IR absorption spectra were taken by\nusing deuterated phosphate bu\ufb00er at pD 8 and show a broad\nband from 1635 to 1650 cm(cid:2)1 (Fig. 4c), indicating a less ordered\nH-bonding pattern between the peptide backbones.9 Fig. 4d\nshows the linear viscoelastic responses of the DFFI hydrogels.\nThe storage modulus (G0) exceeds the loss modulus (G00) by factor\nof 22 demonstrating that the tripeptides formed viscoelastic gels.\nThe results indicate that using one-directional ultrasound, which\nprovides di\ufb00erential influences of self-assembly of peptides in\nboth organic and aqueous media by dramatically increasing the\nhydrophobic stacking and hydrophilic hydrogen bonding inter-\nactions, gives rise to the enhancement of chirality, orientation\nand gelation process.\nFollowing the same experimental procedure as mentioned\nabove, we used a standard sonication bath (the frequency is around\n40 kHz with varied acoustic pressure and amplitude) as a control\nexperiment. Fig. S2 (ESI\u2020) shows that the sonication bath can also\ntrigger the gelation of DFFD in methanol and DFFI in bu\ufb00er\nsolution. However, disordered fibrous structures are observed by\nSEM (Fig. S2, ESI\u2020), which proves that oscillating pressure waves\ngive rise to the highly oriented peptide self-assembly.\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate the use of ultrasonic waves as\nan in situ approach to induce the self-assembly and alignment of\ntripeptides forming highly ordered micro-fibrous structures in\nboth organic and aqueous media. Two di\ufb00erent peptides were\nstudied, DFFD and DFFI with the former forming an anisotropic\norganogel in methanol, while the latter forms an anisotropic\nhydrogel, showing that the anisotropic arrangement of supra-\nmolecular interactions is highly related to the peptide sequences\nand solvent environment. These results indicate that the influence\nFig. 3 TEM images of DFFI in phosphate bu\ufb00er (pH 8) (a) before and (b) after\nultrasound irradiation.

However, poor aqueous \nsolubility and low bioavailability of curcumin is a major challenge in its \ndevelopment as a useful drug. To enhance the aqueous solubility and \nbioavailability of curcumin, attempts have been made to encapsulate it in \nliposomes, polymeric nanoparticles (NPs), lipid-based NPs, biodegradable \nmicrospheres, cyclodextrin, and hydrogels.\nMETHODS: In this work, we attempted to entrap curcumin in novel self-assembled \ndipeptide NPs containing a nonprotein amino acid, \u03b1, \u03b2-dehydrophenylalanine, and \ninvestigated the biological activity of dipeptide-curcumin NPs in cancer models \nboth in vitro and in vivo.\nRESULTS: Of the several dehydrodipeptides tested, \nmethionine-dehydrophenylalanine was the most suitable one for loading and \nrelease of curcumin. Loading of curcumin in the dipeptide NPs increased its \nsolubility, improved cellular availability, enhanced its toxicity towards \ndifferent cancerous cell lines, and enhanced curcumin's efficacy towards \ninhibiting tumor growth in Balb/c mice bearing a B6F10 melanoma tumor.\nCONCLUSION: These novel, highly biocompatible, and easy to construct dipeptide \nNPs with a capacity to load and release curcumin in a sustained manner \nsignificantly improved curcumin's cellular uptake without altering its \nanticancer or other therapeutic properties. Curcumin-dipeptide NPs also showed \nimproved in vitro and in vivo chemotherapeutic efficacy compared to curcumin \nalone. Such dipeptide-NPs may also improve the delivery of other potent \nhydrophobic drug molecules that show poor cellular uptake, bioavailability, and \nefficacy.\n\nMaterials and methods\nMaterials\nCurcumin (diferuloyl methane), tetrahydrofuran, N-methyl \nmorpholine,  isobutyl  chloroformate,  trifluoroacetic  acid, \nmethanol,  1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol  (HFIP), \nphenol,  and  DL-threo-phenylserine  were  from  Sigma-\nAldrich  (Munich,  Germany).

Image analysis to measure particle \ndimensions was carried out using the iTem software package \n(FEI, Hillsboro, OR).\nLoading of curcumin in dipeptide NPs \nand determination of curcumin-loading \nefficiency and drug-loading content\nCurcumin  solution  in  methanol  was  added  to  preformed \nNPs at a ratio of 1:1 w/w, and the mixtures were incubated \nfor  48  hours  at  room  temperature  with  constant  shaking. \nMethanol was evaporated under a vacuum and free curcumin \nwas separated from that entrapped in NPs by centrifugation \nat  800  \u00d7  g  for  15  minutes  in  a  MultiScreen  96-well  filter \nplate  (Millipore,  Billerica,  MA).  Curcumin  content  in  the \nfiltrate was quantified using UV-vis spectroscopy at 426 nm. \nThe percentage entrapped curcumin in dipeptide NPs was \ndetermined using the following equation:\nTo determine the exact quantity of curcumin in dipep-\ntide NPs, curcumin was loaded in NPs as described above \n(1:1  w/w  of  curcumin  in  1  mL  of  dipeptide  NPs).  Free \ncurcumin  was  separated  from  that  entrapped  in  NPs  by \ncentrifugation at 800 \u00d7 g for 15 minutes in a MultiScreen \n96-well filter plate (Millipore). Samples were washed three \ntimes  with  PBS  and  NPs  were  then  dissolved  by  adding \n200 \u00b5L of neat methanol. Curcumin content was determined \nby comparing the sample with curcumin standard curve in \nmethanol using the following equation:\nAnalysis of photophysical properties  \nof curcumin and curcumin loaded  \nin dipeptide NPs\nTo determine whether entrapment in dipeptide NPs had an \neffect on curcumin\u2019s photophysical properties, spectroscopic \nanalysis was condcuted.20 The absorbance and fluorescence \nspectra of both native curcumin and (Cm)NPs at a concentra-\ntion of 1 mg/mL were measured in a 50:50 (v/v) methanol: \nwater solution. Absorption spectra were recorded from 350 \nto 600 nm (Lambda 35; Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) and \nfluorescence  emission  spectra  were  recorded  from  450  to \n700 nm with an excitation wavelength of 420 nm (LS 55; \nPerkin Elmer).\nIn vitro curcumin release\nCurcumin release studies were carried out using the dialysis \nbag method.21 A known quantity (1.0 mg/mL) of (Cm)NPs \nwas placed in a dialysis membrane tube with a molecular \nweight  cut-off  of  3000  Da  (SnakeSkinTM  Pleated  Dialysis \nTubing; Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Because of the low \nsolubility of curcumin in aqueous media, the release study \nwas carried out by immersing the tube in a beaker containing \n50 mL of 50:50 (v/v) methanol: water solution to facilitate \nsink-like conditions and stirred constantly at room tempera-\nture for 36 hours. At various time points, 1 mL of solution \nwas withdrawn from the release medium and replaced with \nfresh PBS. Samples were lyophilized and dissolved in 100 \u00b5L \nof  methanol  to  determine  curcumin  content  using  UV-vis \nspectroscopy (Lambda 35; Perkin Elmer).\nFluorescence and flow cytometric \nanalysis for cellular uptake of NPs\nTaking  advantage  of  the  intrinsic  green  fluorescence  of \ncurcumin,  we  studied  its  cellular  uptake  by  fluorescence \nmicroscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) \nanalysis. HeLa cells were grown in 6-well culture plates at \n37\u00b0C  in  a  5%  CO2  incubator  up  to  80%  confluency.  Cells \nwere  then  treated  with  30 \u00b5M  native  curcumin,  (Cm)NPs, \nand void NPs for 24 hours and analyzed for curcumin uptake. \nFor  microscopic  analysis,  cells  were  fixed  using  fixative \n( Sigma-Aldrich), washed three times with PBS, and analyzed \nunder a fluorescence microscope (Eclipse TE2000-U; Nikon, \nTokyo, Japan) to measure intracellular curcumin  fluorescence. \nFor FACS analysis, cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS \nthree times, and resuspended in 500 \u00b5L sheath fluid (Becton \nDickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and examined using FACS-\nCaliber flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).\nCytotoxicity of (Cm)NPs towards \ndifferent cancerous cell lines\nHeLa, MCF-7, or HUH-7 cells were plated (1 \u00d7 104 cells/\nwell)  in  triplicate  in  96-well  sterile  microtiter  plates \n(Corning) and allowed to grow for 12 hours for proper cell \nadherence. Cells were then treated with different concen-\ntrations (10\u201330 \u00b5M of free curcumin, (Cm)NPs, and void \ndipeptide NPs for 24 hours. Cells incubated with 20 \u00b5L of \nPBS were used as a control. After incubation, the media \nwas discarded and replaced with 180 \u00b5L of fresh growth \nmedium. Subsequently, 20 \u00b5L of MTT reagent, (5 mg/mL) \nwas added to each well. The plate was then incubated at \n37\u00b0C under 5% CO2 for 4 hours. The medium was removed, \nand 100 \u00b5L of dimethylsulfoxide was added to solubilize \nthe formazan crystals. Optical density was then taken at \n572 nm, subtracting for plate absorbance at 690 nm. The \npercentage  of  viable  cells  was  calculated  based  on  the \n following equation:\ntaken at 572 nm,  subtracting for plate absorbance at 690 nm. \nThe percentage of viable cells was calculated based on the \nfollowing equation:\nApoptosis assay\nHeLa cells were seeded (2.5\u20133.0 \u00d7 105 cells/plate) on 60-mm \nplates and incubated until 80% confluency was reached. Cells \nwere then treated with 30 \u00b5M of free curcumin and the same \namount of (Cm)NPs based on the cytotoxicity results, which \nwas used to determine the maximum cell killing efficacy at a \nconcentration of 30 \u00b5M. As a control, cells were incubated \nwith complete growth medium. After 24 hours, cells were \nharvested  by  quick  trypsinization  to  minimize  potentially \nhigh annexin V background levels in adherent cells, washed \ntwice with cold PBS, and stained with annexin V-fluorescein \nisothiocyanate  (FITC)  and  propidium  iodide  (PI)  in  bind-\ning  buffer  as  directed  by  the Vybrant  apoptosis  assay  kit \n(V13241; Invitrogen). Stained cells were placed on ice and \nprotected  from  light  until  reading  using  flow  cytometry. \nProcessed single-cell suspensions were analyzed on a FAC-\nSCaliber flow cytometer with a laser excitation wavelength \nof 488 nm. The green signal from fluorescein isothiocyanate/\nannexin V was measured at 525 nm and the red signal from PI \nwas measured at 620 nm. Cells that stained negative for both \nannexin V and PI were viable. Cells that were annexin V+/\nPI- were in early apoptosis, whereas cells that were necrotic \nor in late apoptosis were annexin V+/PI+.\nCytotoxicity of NPs towards L-929 \n(human fibroblast) cells\nL-929 cells were plated (1 \u00d7 104 cells/well) in triplicate in \n96-well  sterile  microtiter  plates  (Corning)  and  allowed  to \ngrow  for  12  hours  for  proper  cell  adherence.  Cells  were \nthen  treated  with  different  concentrations  (20\u201350  \u00b5M)  of \nvoid dipeptide NPs for 24 hours. Cells incubated with 20 \u00b5L \nof PBS were used as a control. After incubation, the media \nwas  discarded  and  replaced  with  180  \u00b5L  of  fresh  growth \nmedium. Subsequently, 20 \u00b5L of MTT reagent (5 mg/mL) \nwas  added  to  each  well.

As such, a flexible backbone template must be\ncreated through simulation.\nassociating tripeptides, MD simulations were performed for this\nthe plausible\npurpose, which produced many snapshots of\nmultimeric complex. These snapshots were then used to produce\na flexible backbone template. The flexible backbone template was\nsubsequently used as the input for the design framework. The first\nstage of the framework is Sequence Selection, which is based on a\nglobal optimization method that minimizes the potential energy of\na designed sequence in the flexible template structure. The\npotential energy used can either be based on an 8-bin Ca-Ca force\nfield or an 8-bin centroid-centroid force field [93,94]. A novel\naspect of this method is the mathematical connection of residues in\nthe design framework, so that identical chains in the template\nstructure remain identical throughout the design procedure. The\noptimized sequences are then subjected to a Fold Specificity\ncalculation and screening. Fold Specificity assesses how energet-\nically favorable it is for the designed sequence to adopt the target\nmultimeric structure in comparison to the native sequence. In\ncases where the native sequence is known to associate, Fold\nSpecificity aims to produce designed sequences that are more\nenergetically favorable in the target multimeric structure than the\nnative sequence. In cases where the native sequence does not\nassemble, sequences with higher Fold Specificity are considered to\nhave a higher chance of adopting the novel multimeric structure.\nFinally, a subset of high confidence sequences is subjected to an\nPyRosetta [95] was used to generate the initial tripeptide models\nfor the template sequence Ac-IVD through a Monte Carlo (MC)\nconformational\nfunction \u2018\u2018make_pose_from_se-\nquence\u2019\u2019 was used in conjunction with the \u2018\u2018fa_standard\u2019\u2019 Rosetta\nforce field [96]. A SmallMover object was constructed with the\nbackbone being allowed to move, with 5 MC perturbations per\ncycle. The model was subjected to 60,000 MC cycles, with the\nMetropolis criterion determining whether a move was accepted or\nrejected. This procedure was used to generate 200 low energy\ndecoys for the template. The models were then clustered in\nRosetta. The four lowest energy models from the densest cluster\nwere centered at the origin.\nIn CHARMM, the four tripeptides were translated 8 A\u02da in both\nthe y- and z- directions so as to form a square box with the\ndistance from the center of the box to the center of each peptide\nbeing 11.31 A\u02da . Each tripeptide was rotated randomly. \u2018\u2018Hbuild\u2019\u2019\nwas used to construct the hydrogen atoms. Periodic boundary\nconditions, which determine the length and (consequently) volume\nof the box, were applied in CHARMM so that the concentration\nthe system was 20 mg/mL. The nonbonded cutoffs\nCHARMM were set using the following options and values:\nctonnb 20, ctofnb 20, cutnb 24, and cutim 24. Implicit solvent was\ninvoked using the generalized Born with simple switching model\n[97]. A half smoothing length of 0.3 A\u02da , a non-polar surface tension\nmolA2, and a grid spacing of 1.5 A\u02da were used.\nThe system was subjected to 2,000 steps of steepest descent,\nfollowed by 2,000 steps of adopted basis-set Newton-Raphson, and\nfinally an additional 2,000 steps of steepest descent minimization.\nThe system was heated to 300 K over 10 ps (stepsize: 0.5 fs) and\nwith harmonic constraints on all heavy atoms with force constant\nmolA2. The system (N,V,T ensemble) was equilibrated for\nmolA2 on all heavy\natoms. The system was subjected to 10 ns of molecular dynamics\n(MD) at 300 K, with SHAKE constraints applied to all bonds\ninvolving a hydrogen atom with a tolerance of 1\u201310. All\nsimulations were performed using Langevin dynamics with the\nleapfrog integration scheme. The last 5 ns of\nthe simulation\ntrajectory were processed into pdb files, which were used as the\nflexible template for design.\nthe template\nsequence Ac-IVD, the motif [hydrophobic]-[hydrophobic]-[E/D]\nwas applied in the computational method. The hydrophobic\nresidues were allowed to mutate to Leu, Ile, Val, Ala as utilized in\nthe self-assembling hexapeptide Ac-LIVAGD [11], as well as Met,\nPhe, Tyr, and Trp. Aromatic moieties have been observed to be\nimportant for association due to p-stacking, so aromatic residues\nwere included to expand the scope of tripeptides available for\ncomparison. This resulted in a total of 128 candidate tripeptide\nsequences, which is a small enough pool that no further biological\nor mutational constraints were required. Previously developed 8-\nbin Ca-Ca and centroid-centroid force fields\n[93,94] were\navailable for use as the potential energy function in the Sequence\nSelection stage. In this study, the 8-bin centroid-centroid force\nfield was employed, since unlike the Ca-Ca force fields,\ncentroid-centroid force field implicitly includes side-chain direc-\ntionality in the potential energy calculation.\nSince the template for tripeptide association was determined\nthrough MD simulations,\nthe optimization-based Sequence\nSelection method was used with a flexible template rather than\na rigid backbone template. Two previous methods were developed\nfor flexible template protein design: a Weighted-average method\nand a Distance Bin method [70\u201372]. The Weighted-average\nmethod takes into account each flexible template, such that the\npotential energy of the system is the average of all the determined\ntemplates in the flexible ensemble. The Distance Bin method\nallows for the optimization method to design not only for the\nsequence, but also for the optimal interaction distances for each\nresidue-residue interaction. The Distance Bin method represents\nthe most rigorous way of designing with a flexible backbone. For\nthis reason, the Distance Bin Sequence Selection framework for\nmultimeric system design was the chosen framework that was used\nin this study.\nThe model minimizes the summation of pairwise interaction\nenergies Ejl\nik, which is the interaction between residue types j and l\nin residue positions i and k whose distance apart falls in distance\nbin d. The binary variable yj\ni equals 1 if residue type j is in residue\nposition i, and 0 otherwise. The binary variable wjl\nik equals 1 if, and\nonly if, yj\nk are both equal to 1, and is 0 otherwise. This\nrepresents an exact linearization of the problem. The final binary\nvariable bikd is allowed to equal 1, if and only if, the distance\nbetween positions i and k fall into distance bin d in at least one of\nthe flexible models in the template. In this way, the model is\nallowed to select one, and only one, distance bin in which two\nresidues can fall, from the set of distance bins observed in the\nflexible template. A new element of this model is the addition of a\nmathematical parameter denoted here as SConnexik to connect\ndesign constraints between multiple chains. This parameter is\ndefined as 1 if two design positions (i and k) are identical positions\nin a design system. For example, in the design of a dimer, two\nTo further validate and analyze the 128 possible tripeptides, a\nmethod capable of calculating the Fold Specificity [70] for sequences\nin multimeric systems was developed. This method uses a constrained\nannealing simulation in CYANA [98,99] to produce a set of initial\nmodels. A local AMBER energy minimization using TINKER [100]\nis then performed on each model to produce a set of 500 final models,\nalong with corresponding AMBER ff94 energy values [101]. Using\nthese AMBER energy values the Fold Specificity value is calculated as\nwhere \u2018\u2018New\u2019\u2019 is the set of models produced for the new sequence,\n\u2018\u2018native\u2019\u2019 is the set of models produced for the reference sequence Ac-\nIVD, and Ei is the AMBER energy value calculated for model i.\nPhysically, Fold Specificity assesses how energetically favorable it is\nfor the designed sequences to adopt the target multimeric structure in\ncomparison to the native sequence. The aim is to assess the specificity\nof the designed sequences for the target structure using a more\ndetailed, atomistic potential energy than in the Sequence Selection\nstage. Since the metric compares the energy values of the designed\nsequence directly to those of the native sequence, a \u2018\u2018favorable\u2019\u2019\nsequence is one that has a Fold Specificity value greater than 1.\nPyRosetta was used to construct initial coordinates of the subset\nof the 128 tripeptide sequences that ranked highly in the Fold\nSpecificity metric. The MC and MD protocols, which were\ndescribed previously in the Template Generation section, were\nused to generate a trajectory for each candidate sequence. The\nensemble of models generated through this dynamics run could\nthen be used in the calculation of an Approximate Association\nAffinity of four tripeptides associating together in the simulations.\nSince the tripeptides have high flexibility, they do not have a single\nstable state. Thus, the simulations did not attempt to reproduce\nthe three-dimensional structure of an associate precursor [11], but\nto provide an estimation of the affinity of a particular sequence to\nitself through physics-based intermolecular interactions.\nThis metric was used in conjunction with the Jacobi logarithm\n[102] to avoid numerical overflow in the calculation. K*\nassociation was\ncalculated for each candidate sequence and rank-ordered from the\nhighest (most favorable spontaneous association) to the lowest\n(Table S1). The simulation of each design was then visually\ninspected to assess whether the tripeptides associated during the\nsimulation and thus fit to the model. Sequences that did not\nassociate were not considered regardless of\nmetric. The final set of designed sequences picked for experimen-\ntal assessment was\nselected via a combination of Potential\nEnergy, Fold Specificity, and Approximate Association Affinity.\nThe criteria for this selection are provided in more detail in the\nMaterials and preparations. The tripeptides (Ac-LVE, Ac-\nYYD, Ac-LLE, Ac-YLD, Ac-MYD, Ac-VIE) were purchased from\nAmerican Peptide Company (Sunnyvale, CA, USA), while Ac-\nYMD, Ac-DMY, Ac-IVE, and Ac-EVI were manually synthesized\nvia solid phase peptide synthesis [103] and purified to .95% via\nHPLC. Amino acid content (AA %) analysis was performed and\nthe actual peptide content of each sample was determined by\ncalculating the net weight (gross weight6AA %). The peptides\nwere dissolved by vortexing in deionized water.

These tryptophan containing peptides can self-assemble to spherical particle. This\nself-assembled system was demonstrated to encapsulate rhodamine B and penetrate the cell membrane.\n(cid:1) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\nCPPs have been shown to interact with the negatively charged\nglycosaminoglycans15,16 and lipids17 present on the cell mem-\nbrane. Membrane hydrophobicity is an important aspect, however\nvery high hydrophobicity suppresses internalization by promoting\naggregation and strong cell membrane binding. Therefore, a bal-\nance between hydrophobicity and charge is crucial for membrane\npenetration.18,19 The application of CPPs range from delivering\nlow molecular weight drugs to macromolecules such as nucleic\nacids and proteins to the speci\ufb01c site.20 CPPs are widely employed\nfor delivering chemotherapeutic drugs like doxorubicin21\u201323, pacli-\ntaxel24\u201326, methotrexate27 as well as macromolecules like proteins\nand oligonucleotides.28 Though the mechanism of transport across\nmembrane is still in debate, it is believed that CPPs deliver cargo by\ndirect penetration of the plasma membrane or by endocytosis.29\nThe general strategy of CPP design has been the introduction of\nHere, we report, self-assembly as a strategy for the design of\nspherical particles that can load cargo into its interior and traverse\nthrough the cell membrane with the cargo. We envisioned that\nself-assembled hollow sphere is an ideal supramolecular system\nfor entrapping drugs or biomolecules inside its cavity and such\nself-assembled system if garnered with the ability to cross the cell\nmembrane will turn out to be excellent cell penetrating system.34\nThe design of molecules with the ability to assemble as spheres\nhaving encapsulation ability coupled with cell penetration is a\nchallenge. For this purpose, it is necessary to bring both these\naspects, such as self-assembly and cell penetration, into a single\nmolecule. Amino acid tryptophan (Trp) has a hydrophobic indole\nside chain, which can promote p\u2013p interactions, and thus endowed\nwith dual properties such as membrane af\ufb01nity and self-\nassembly.35\nfor self-assembly and cellular uptake studies.36 The N-protected\npeptide derivatives W1a\u2013W4a were insoluble in aqueous medium,\ntherefore N-deprotected derivatives W1b\u2013W4b were synthesized\nto make them water soluble and suitable for biological studies.\nSelf-assembling behavior of W1a\u2013W4a and W1b\u2013W4b was\nstudied by various microscopic techniques. Scanning electron\nmicroscopic (SEM) imaging of W1a\u2013W4a in 1:1 MeOH/CHCl3 (SI,\nFig. S1) and W1b\u2013W4b (Fig. 2(a\u2013d)) in 1:1 MeOH/H2O show that\nthese peptides assemble into spherical morphology. Transmission\nelectron microscopic (TEM) (stained with 0.2% phosphotungstic\nacid) (SI, Figs. S2 and S3) and atomic force microscopic (AFM) (SI,\nFig. S4) studies revealed that W1a, b\u2013W4a, b form spheres in the\nrange of (cid:1)0.6\u20132 lm. The analysis of SEM images of W1b\u2013W4b\nshow average diameter of vesicles in the range (cid:1)0.3\u20132 lm (SI,\nFig. S5) which approximately matches from other microscopic\nThe average sizes obtained from microscopic studies were in\npartial agreement with that obtained from the dynamic light scat-\ntering studies (SI, Fig. S6). Detailed analysis of SEM images of W1b\u2013\nW4b revealed that the average size of these spherical aggregates\nincreased as the branching increased.\nFluorescence microscopic analysis of W1b\u2013W4b alone and\nmixed with rhodamine B revealed the dye entrapment potential\nthese spherical aggregates. The spheres from W1b\u2013W4b\nappeared as blue (kex = 450\u2013490 nm) (Fig. 2(e) and SI, Fig. S7),\nwhile the rhodamine B loaded spheres were red colored\n(kex = 510\u2013560 nm) demonstrating encapsulation of the dye by\nthe spheres (Fig. 2(f) and SI, Fig. S7).\nAfter discovering the spherical self-assembly and encapsulation\nability of the peptides, these peptides were tested for their poten-\ntial for cellular uptake and cargo delivery. Murine macrophage cell\nline J774A.1 was chosen for this purpose. Initially the cytotoxicity\nFigure 2. SEM images of (a) W1b (2.54 mM), (b) W2b (2.72 mM), (c) W3b (3.3 mM), (d) W4b (2.2 mM). Fluorescence microscopic images of W2b (e) alone (kex =\n450\u2013490 nm), (f) with 0.02 equiv of rhodamine B (kex = 510\u2013560 nm) in 1:1 MeOH/H2O.\npro\ufb01le of the peptides was studied by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthia-\nzol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay.37 Brie\ufb02y mur-\nine macrophage cells (J774A.1) were seeded in 96 well plate\n(10,000 cells/well) in serum supplemented media at pH 7.4. Serum\nfree media was used for the dilution of compounds to avoid inter-\nactions of peptides with proteins present in serum. Cells were trea-\nted with different concentrations of the peptides (W1b\u2013W4b) for\n24 h at 37 (cid:3)C in CO2 incubator followed by incubation with\n100 lL of 0.5 mg/mL of MTT in serum free media for 4 h at 37 (cid:3)C\nin a CO2 incubator. Formazan crystals formed after reduction of\nMTT were dissolved in 100 lL of DMSO and absorbance measured\nat 570 nm with reference of 630 nm in a multiwell plate reader.\nCellular viability was calculated as per the formula: (OD of test/\nOD of control) (cid:3) 100. Each experiment was performed in tripli-\ncates. The Fig. 3(a) shows average percentage viability of cells at\ndifferent peptide concentrations revealing that nearly all peptides\n(W1b\u2013W4b) exhibit (cid:1)100% viability at a concentration of 60 lg/\nmL (45\u2013101 lM) and thus ideal for biological applications. W2b\nand W3b showed (cid:1)100% viability even at higher concentrations\n(120\u2013500 lg/mL), whereas W1b and W4b showed lesser viability\nrevealing higher biocompatibility of W2b and W3b. All further\ncellular interaction studies were carried out at non toxic concen-\ntration of 60 lg/mL for all compounds.\nThe intrinsic \ufb02uorescence of Trp was used for the detection of\nthese compounds in the cells (SI, Fig. S8).38 Interestingly, we\ncould observe the spherical aggregates as green (kex = 494 nm)\nspots without any additional \ufb02uorescent\nlabeling. Confocal\nmicroscopy of\nthe cells treated with the peptides for 4 h\nshowed the presence of peptides in the intracellular region (Fig. 3\n(c) and SI, Fig. S9). The nucleus of the cells is stained (blue) with\n40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), actin is stained (red) with\nFigure 3.

The dyes DAPI (kex = 358 nm;\nkem = 461 nm) and rhodamine\u2013phalloidin (red) (kex = 540 nm; kem = 565 nm) were used to stain cell nuclei and actin \ufb01laments, respectively, (Bar = 10 lm). Arrows denote\nposition of the peptides inside the cell. (d) Relative percentage uptake of rhodamine B by W1b\u2013W4b at 37 (cid:3)C, 4 (cid:3)C and with endocytosis inhibitor cytochalasin B (at 37 (cid:3)C)\n(statistical analysis was carried out with Graph Pad Prism V 6.01. Groups were analyzed using ordinary two-way ANOVA. P value less than 0.05 was considered to be\nsigni\ufb01cant, ns = not signi\ufb01cant).\nTo investigate the uptake mechanism, \ufb02ow cytometry experi-\nments were performed with W1b\u2013W4b at 4 (cid:3)C. The results (Fig. 3\n(b) and SI, Fig. S11) show that the percentage uptake ef\ufb01ciency is\nreduced at 4 (cid:3)C. Therefore, the plausible mechanism of cellular\nuptake of W1b\u2013W4b is largely by energy-dependent pathway. To\ncon\ufb01rm the mechanism, we performed cellular uptake study\n(Fig. 3b) in the presence of cytochalasin B, an endocytosis inhibitor.\nInterestingly in the presence of cytochalasin B, there was no\nreduction in the uptake of the peptides, in fact the cellular uptake\nwas increased slightly for compounds W1b\u2013W4b. This infers that,\nthese peptides do not enter cells using endocytosis. One possible\nexplanation could be that as these peptides are hydrophobic in\nnature, they may interact with the cell membrane and enters in\nto the cells. This is con\ufb01rmed from the SEM images of the cells\ntreated with W1b\u2013W4b (SI, Fig. S12) for 24 h which showed gran-\nular appearance on the cell surface which suggests that the spher-\nical aggregates adhere to the cell membrane prior to entry. Thus\nthe membrane interacting properties of these peptides may be\nresponsible for its internalization.\nHaving established the cellular uptake ability of these peptides,\nwe evaluated whether these peptides enter into the cell in the form\nof spheres. For investigating this, J774A.1 cells were treated with\nthe rhodamine B alone and rhodamine B encapsulated peptide\nspheres of W1b\u2013W4b for 2 h. Flow cytometry experiments\ncarried out with cells treated with rhodamine B encapsulated\npeptide spheres showed higher uptake of rhodamine B into the\ncells as compared to the cells treated with rhodamine B alone\nunderscoring that the self-assembling peptides act as carrier\nsystems (Fig. 3(d)). The dot plot based on FACS data clearly sup-\nported this \ufb01nding (SI, Fig. S13). The confocal microscopic images\nshowed presence of rhodamine B (kex = 510 nm) in the cell interior\n(Fig. 4(a, b) and SI, Fig. S14), providing a compelling evidence of\nrhodamine transport by the self-assembled spherical aggregates.\nFig. 4(b) showing very faint spot corresponding to W3b indicates\nlowest uptake ef\ufb01ciency in agreement with the FACS data (Fig. 3\n(b and d)). Amongst all the compounds, W1b showed highest\nef\ufb01ciency in delivering cargo rhodamine B into the cells. The quan-\nti\ufb01cation of uptake of peptides (W1b\u2013W4b) with and without dye\nby \ufb02ow cytometry data along with the results obtained from con-\nfocal microscopic studies suggest that W1b (Figs. 3(b\u2013d) and 4(a))\nshowed highest uptake ef\ufb01ciency while W3b (Figs. 3(b, d) and 4\n(b)) has relatively less ef\ufb01ciency for cellular uptake as compared\nto other peptides.\nIn summary, we have designed and synthesized linear and\ndendrimeric tryptophan-based self-assembling peptides. These\npeptides self-assemble to spheres that encapsulate rhodamine B\nand traverse the cell membrane by energy-dependent process.\nThe studies presented here demonstrate that self-assembly\nprovides the encapsulation ability, while Trp units provide cellular\nuptake properties. These topologically and chemically diverse class\nof self-assembling peptides would be of tremendous interest to\nchemical, biological, medical and nanotechnological applications.\nThe enormous chemical space available for peptide design further\nexpands the scope of this work.\n12.

KFG self-assembles in water and shows a reversible\nand concentration-dependent switching of nanostructures from\nnanospheres (vesicles) to nanotubes, as evidenced by dynamic\nlight scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic\nforce microscopy. The morphology change was associated with\na transition in the secondary structure. The tripeptide vesicles\nhave inner aqueous compartments and are stable at pH 7.4 but\nrupture rapidly at pH (cid:2) 6. The pH-sensitive response of the\nvesicles was exploited for the delivery of a chemotherapeutic\nanticancer drug, doxorubicin, which resulted in enhanced\ncytotoxicity for both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells.\nEfficient intracellular release of the drug was confirmed by\nfluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, fluorescence mi-\ncroscopy, and confocal microscopy.\nmimicking natural processes is among the leading approaches\nin nanobiotechnology.[1] Toward therapeutic goals, one of the\nemerging interests is the development of biocompatible\nnanocarriers for efficient drug delivery.[2] The main aim is to\novercome barriers that stand against the therapeutic potential\nof drugs, like overload side-effects,[3] specific cell targeting,[4]\nthe development of multidrug resistance (MDR),[5] and the\nblood\u2013brain barrier in gliomas.[6] In order to solve such\noutstanding problems, \u201cdecorated\u201d liposomes,[7] multifunc-\ntional micelles,[8] polymeric hydrogels,[9]\nfunctionalized\norganic[10] and inorganic nanomaterials,[11] etc. have been\nemployed. Among these, building blocks that are organized\nfrom short peptide sequences have become promising tools\nfor biomedical applications.[12, 13]\nProf. P. Kondaiah\nDepartment of Molecular Reproduction, Development and Genetics\nIndian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560 012 (India)\nRecently, stimuli-responsive morphological transforma-\ntions of short peptide sequences in water have also been\nreported.[12, 14] We considered a short tripeptide sequence\n(Lys\u2013Phe\u2013Gly or KFG) that is situated in the juxtamembrane\nregion of the tyrosine kinase nerve growth factor (Trk NGF)\nreceptors, which are involved in neuronal growth and differ-\nentiation. The absence of the KFG sequence in the receptor\npolypeptide chain seriously affects the activation of signaling\ncascades including the Ras superfamily, phosphoinositide 3-\nkinase, and the Suc1-associated neurotrophic factor target\n(SNT) protein.[15] This also results in impaired neurite out-\ngrowth and sometic hypertrophy. This small but critically\nconserved entity, which plays an important role in the growth\nfactor signal transduction process, was chosen for the present\nstudy. We investigated this biologically important tripeptide,\nKFG (Figure 1), which spontaneously self-assembled into\ndefined nanostructures in aqueous media. The tripeptide\nshowed an exciting phenomenon of reversible and concen-\ntration-dependent switching of nanostructures between nano-\nvesicles and nanotubes. This change in morphology was\nassociated with a transition in the secondary structure at the\npeptide level. The vesicles that resulted from the self-\nassembly of KFG were extremely sensitive toward the pH\nvalue of the medium. They were stable at pH 7.4 but ruptured\nrapidly at pH (cid:2) 6. This property is often exploited for\nimproved cellular internalizations in anticancer drug deliv-\nery.[11c, 16] The pH-sensitive nature of the vesicles was accord-\ningly tested for the delivery of one of the most widely used\ndrugs for many types of cancer, doxorubicin (DOX). Cellular\nuptake of DOX dramatically increased after the drug was\nloaded into the vesicles. Overall, we report for the first time\na smart stimulus-responsive (pH-induced) tripeptide-based\nself-assembled nanocarrier that induces significant therapeu-\ntic delivery of a chemotherapeutic drug, DOX, to cancer cells.\nTo discern the nature of the supramolecular structures\nthat were formed upon self-assembly of Lys\u2013Phe\u2013Gly,\ndynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were per-\nformed. At\ntripeptide\nlow concentration of\n(0.5 mg mL(cid:3)1), nanostructures of approximately 50\u201370 nm\nwere observed, whereas aggregates of about 190\u2013200 nm were\nformed at a higher concentration (5 mg mL(cid:3)1; Figure S5 in the\nSupporting Information). Interestingly, we found that this\ntransition in the sizes of the nanostructures is reversible in\nnature (Figure S6). These observations prompted us to\ninvestigate the KFG aggregates at various concentrations by\nusing transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The tripep-\ntide formed spherical structures with diameters of (50 (cid:4)\n10) nm at the low concentration, whereas it formed tubular\naggregates with diameters of (190 (cid:4) 10) nm at the higher\nconcentration (Figure S7). Atomic force microscopy (AFM;\nFigure 2) showed morphological features of the tripeptide\naggregates similar to those observed in the TEM observa-\nFigure 2. AFM images showing the topography of the KFG tripeptide\nat different concentrations: a) 0.5 mg mL(cid:3)1 and b) 5 mg mL(cid:3)1. The\ndouble arrow between (a) and (b) indicates that the transition from\nnanovesicles to nanotubes is reversible as a function of concentration.\nFigure 3. a) CD spectra of KFG at two different concentrations.\nb) Schematic illustration of the concentration-dependent self-assembly\nprocess of the tripeptide.\nThe thermotropic properties of the tripeptide self-assem-\nblies at both concentrations in aqueous media were inves-\ntigated by high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry\n(DSC).[17] The suspension of KFG at low concentration\n(vesicles) did not show any transition in the temperature\nrange 20\u201370 8C, but at the higher concentration (nanotubes),\nthe tripeptide showed a quasireversible transition during\nheating and cooling scans. Two peaks appeared at approx-\nimately 47 and 60 8C (Figure S8). The DSC results were\ncorroborated by using temperature-dependent AFM studies\nat low and high concentrations (Figure S9). There was no\nchange in the morphology of the vesicles even after the\nsample had been heated up to 85 8C, but the nanotubes\nchanged topology upon heating. The transition from tubular\nto spherical nanostructures (vesicles) started occurring from\n45 8C and ended at 60 8C. Above 90 8C, the vesicular structures\ncollapsed, probably due to water evaporation. Interestingly,\nsuch a temperature-induced transition from tubular-to-vesic-\nular morphology is quite unprecedented.\nthe tripeptide\nexhibited a maximum at 196 nm and a minimum at 218 nm\nin the CD spectrum (Figure 3). This signature in the CD\nspectrum is analogous to those of b sheets in polypeptides.\nAfter dilution of this suspension to 0.5 mg mL(cid:3)1, the CD\nspectrum showed a negative band at 195 nm together with\na positive band at 212 nm, which suggests the formation of\na (cid:2)random-coil(cid:3) structure.[18] This change in the secondary\nstructure from a b sheet to a random coil occurs upon dilution\nof the tripeptide, which is also associated with the morpho-\nlogical transition. Again, such a reversible transition from\nvesicles to nanotubes along with changes in the secondary\nstructure is rarely observed, to the best of our knowledge.\nFurthermore, we examined the self-assembly by molecular\nmodeling studies (Figure S10), which evidenced that the\npeptide assemblies are formed mainly due to the interplay of\nelectrostatic, p-stacking, and H-bonding interactions.\nEven if the particles appear to be nearly spherical, it may\nnot necessarily signify that they are vesicles and not solid\nnanoparticles. It is important to know whether the nano-\nspheres derived from the tripeptide assemblies possess inner\naqueous compartments. Therefore, we attempted to encap-\nsulate a water-soluble solute or a drug in such particles.\nToward this end, we employed a cationic dye, methylene blue\n(MB),[19] to check the entrapment capacities of the spherical\naggregates in aqueous media. Indeed, the vesicles could\nencapsulate approximately 6.8 % of the total dye inside their\ninner aqueous compartments (Figure S11). In another experi-\nment, we found that these tripeptide vesicles were also able to\nencapsulate the neutral, impermeant, water-soluble solute\nglucose[20] (Figure S12), which has no p-stacking unit, unlike\nthe commonly available aromatic dyes.\nFurthermore, because the tripeptide formed nanovesicles\nspontaneously at physiological pH values and the same\nvesicles could be disrupted at pH 6, we thought of exploiting\nthis property for drug delivery.[16, 21] Accordingly, we loaded\nFigure 4. Fluorescence microscopy images of a) DOX-loaded vesicles\nat pH 7.4 and b) the disruption of the vesicles and drug release at\npH 6. Scale bar: 20 mm.\nthe vesicles with DOX at pH 7.4 (Figure 4 a) and followed the\nrelease of the drug at pH 6 upon rupture of the vesicles\n(Figure 4 b). The percentage of DOX encapsulation was\napproximately 25.7 %, and importantly, the resulting DOX-\nloaded vesicles were also quite stable in buffer containing\nserum (Figure S14). The kinetic profile obtained for the\nsystem showed a zero-order drug release at pH 6, which could\nbe explained on the basis of a non-Fickian diffusion mech-\nanism,[22] as fitted from the Peppas model (Figure S15). Also,\nthe drug release profile of the DOX-loaded vesicles showed\na bimodal release profile, with an initial burst release\nfollowed by a sustained release (Figure S14). A plausible\nreason for this burst release could be the disruption of the\nvesicular self-assembly and the increased hydrophilicity of\nDOX molecules at this lowered pH value. The remaining\namount of DOX, which followed a sustained release profile\nthereafter, could be attributed to the partial adsorption\neffects between the tripeptide assembly and the DOX\nmolecules, as reported in other nanocarrier systems.[11a]\nThe toxicity of the KFG nanovesicles was assayed in cell\nlines of different origins, namely HeLa (human cervical\ncarcinoma), HEK 293T (human embryonic kidney, trans-\nformed), U251 (glioblastoma), and A549 (human lung\nadenocarcinoma) cells. The toxic effect of the empty vesicles\nappeared to be insignificant toward each cell line, with > 95 %\ncells found to be viable (Figure 5 a). The toxicity of the DOX-\nloaded vesicles was then assessed in the same set of cell lines\nand compared with that of free DOX. Notably, the cytotox-\nicity due to the DOX-loaded vesicles was significantly greater\nthan that of free DOX at each of the examined concentrations\n(10, 20, 30, and 40 mg mL(cid:3)1) for the same period of incubation\nin all of the cells studied. The differences in cell viabilities\nbetween the treatment with DOX alone and the DOX-loaded\nvesicles at a representative 20 mg mL(cid:3)1 drug concentration in\nthe above cells are shown in Figure 5 b.\nTo explore the possible reasons for the enhanced toxicity,\nthe internalization of DOX before and after being loaded into\nthe KFG vesicles was examined, both by fluorescence-\nactivated cell sorting (FACS) analysis and fluorescence\nmicroscopy. Based on the FACS data, the geometric mean\nof fluorescence intensity (GMFI) values for cells treated with\nDOX-loaded KFG vesicles were significantly higher than\nthose of the free-DOX-treated cells. This effect was more\nprominent with increased exposure to and concentrations of\nDOX (Figure 6 a) and remained consistent among all of the\ncell lines studied. Representative flow cytometry dot plots\nand histograms for DOX internalization are shown in Fig-\nFigure 5. a) Cytotoxicity of the tripeptide vesicles at different concen-\ntrations. b) Cytotoxicity of DOX-loaded vesicles in comparison with\nfree DOX at a concentration of 20 mg mL(cid:3)1.\nure S16 and S17a, respectively. The fluorescence microscopy\nresults substantiated the observation that the fluorescence\nintensity of the DOX was significantly higher for cells treated\nwith DOX-loaded peptide vesicles than for the free-DOX-\ntreated cells after 1 h of incubation (Figure S17). We also\nassessed the intracellular localization of the drug by confocal\nmicroscopy. Interestingly, cells treated with the DOX-loaded\nvesicles for 4 h showed nuclear localization of the drug with\nFigure 6. a) GMFI of DOX internalizations in HeLa cells at two differ-\nent concentrations based on FACS analysis. The first two stacked bars\nshow the results after 1 h and the second two stacked bars show the\nresults after 4 h. b) Cytotoxicity of DOX-loaded vesicles in HeLa-DOXR\ncells relative to the cytotoxicity with free DOX (20 mg mL(cid:3)1), and GMFI\nvalues in HeLa-DOXR cells after a 4 h incubation (10 mg mL(cid:3)1).\nFigure 7. Representative confocal microscopy images after DOX treat-\nment of HeLa cells at 5 mg mL(cid:3)1 for 4 h (a,b) and HeLa-DOXR cells at\n20 mg mL(cid:3)1 for 24 h (c,d). Panels (a) and (c) represent treatment with\nfree DOX and panels b and d represent treatment with DOX-loaded\nvesicles. Each panel, from left to right, shows the bright-field image,\nDOX fluorescence (red), 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) stained\nnuclei (blue), and an overlay of the last two.\nThis interesting phenomenon of accelerated drug release\nand, thereby, increased cytotoxicity selectively toward the\ncancer cells encouraged us to deal with drug-resistant cell\nlines. We, therefore, performed cell viability experiments and\ndrug internalization studies in DOX-resistant HeLa cells\n(HeLa-DOXR). In this case also, the DOX-loaded vesicles\nwere found to be more efficient in delivering a larger amount\nof the drug at fixed concentrations and time points, which\nimparted greater toxicity than the free DOX (Figure 6 b).\nConfocal microscopy was performed for HeLa-DOXR at\nrelatively longer time points and higher drug concentrations\nbecause of the drug-efflux-related issues in drug-resistant cell\nlines. At an optimized concentration and time point, cells\ntreated with DOX-loaded vesicles showed much higher DOX\nfluorescence than those treated with free DOX, although the\ndrug was mainly localized in the cytoplasm this time (Fig-\nure 7 c,d). Thus, the increased internalization of the drug\ncould be attributed to the pH-sensitive response of the\nvesicles.\nIn summary, we have synthesized a natural tripeptide\n(KFG), which self-assembles to produce vesicles at lower\nconcentration (0.5 mg mL(cid:3)1) and hollow nanotubes at higher\nconcentration (5 mg mL(cid:3)1). The secondary structure of the\ntripeptide changes from random-coil to b-sheet-like assem-\nblies as the concentration is increased. The transition scheme\nin the secondary structure is corroborated well with a molec-\nular modeling study. The vesicles rupture and release their\ncontents at pH (cid:2) 6. A continuous drug release profile\nconsistent with zero-order kinetics is maintained so that the\nconcentration of drug remains constant\ndelivery period. The pH-targeted drug delivery results in an\nenhanced cytotoxicity to both drug-sensitive and drug-resist-\nant cells in vitro. The efficient intracellular release of the drug\nafter loading into vesicles was confirmed by FACS analysis,\nfluorescence microscopy, and confocal microscopy. These\ntripeptide vesicles show the distinct advantage of pH-driven\ntranslocation even in serum, which may be important because\nit may bypass factors involved in drug resistance.\nSuch a system is therefore highly promising as a stimulus-\nresponsive biocompatible nanovehicle that translocates into\ncells once exposed to the tumor pH regime. The fact that this\ntripeptide could be either synthesized readily or obtained\ncommercially makes it particularly attractive for the delivery\nof anticancer drugs selectively to the cancer site with relevant\nfunctionalizations. We are now extending the utility of this by\nexploring its therapeutic potential toward other MDR cell\nlines with specific recognition sites in vivo. With the aim of\neradicating the root of cancer, the specialized cancer stem\ncells that are responsible for the resistance to cancer therapies\nand the recurrence of cancer, work is underway to achieve\ntargeting by a combination chemotherapeutic approach with\nthe design of appropriate aptamer-loaded tripeptide nano-\ncarriers."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"peptide_sequence\":

Samples  were  then \nincubated for 48 h with constant shaking and \nthen centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at \n25\u00b0C in a table top centrifuge. A small volume \nwas removed from the supernatant and free-drug \nconcentration was estimated spectrophotometri-\ncally. The percentage entrapment was calculated \nas described above. \n \u0084 Cytotoxicity assays\nFor cytotoxicity experiments, HeLa cells were \ngrown  in  RPMI-1640  supplemented  with \n10% fetal calf serum. Cells were maintained \non  tissue  culture  treated  polystyrene  plates \n(TCTP)  at  37\u00b0C  in  a  humified  atmosphere \ncontaining 5% CO2. Sub-confluent cells were \ntrypsinized, harvested and counted by a try-\npan  blue  dye  exclusion  test  using  a  hemocy-\ntometer.  The  resulting  cell  suspensions  were \ndiluted using RPMI-1640 (supplemented with \n10% fetal calf serum) and seeded in 96-well \nplates at a cell density of 2 \u00d7 104 cells per well. \nCells were plated in triplicates. After 12 h of \ngrowth, approximately 20 \u00b5l of nanostructures \n(prepared at a concentration of 1 mg/ml water) \nwere added to each well and incubated for a \nperiod of 24 h. Cells incubated with 20 \u00b5l of \nphosphate-buffered saline were taken as a con-\ntrol. After this, cell viability was determined \nusing a traditional MTT assay. The percent-\nage viability was calculated using the equation \ngiven below:\nPercentage viability of cells = ([absorbance \nof MTT formazan produced by cells grown in \npresence of nanostructures/absorbance of MTT \nformazan produced by cells grown on TCTP \ncontrol plate]) \u00d7 100\n \u0084 Cellular uptake of  \ndipeptide nanostructures\nHeLa cells were grown and maintained in TCTP \nplates as described above. Sub-confluent cells \nwere trypsinized, harvested and counted. The \nresulting  cell  suspensions  were  diluted  using \nRPMI-1640  (supplemented  with  10%  fetal \ncalf serum) and seeded in 6-well plates at a cell \ndensity of 1 \u00d7 105 cells per well. 2 \u00b5l of Alexa-\n488  (Invitrogen,  from  stock  of  0.1  mg/20  \u00b5l \ndimethylsulfoxide), was added to sterile stocks \nof nanostructures prepared at a concentration of \n0.1\u20131 mg/ml and incubated for 2 h at room tem-\nperature. Free dyes were removed by centrifuging \nnanostructures in 3 kDa cut-off plates. 200 \u00b5l of \nthese labeled nanostructures were added to HeLa \ncells grown in 6-well plates and incubated for \n18\u201324 h. After this, cells were washed 2\u20133-times \nwith phenol red-free media and observed under \nfluorescence microscope.\n \u0084 In vivo biodistribution of \ndipeptide nanostructures\nRadiolabeling of nanostructures\n99mTc is the most widely used radioisotope in \nnuclear  medicine,  commonly  available  and \nmuch less expensive when compared with 111In \nor 123I. Nanostructures were labeled with 99mTc \nby direct labeling method using stannous tar-\ntarate  and  sodium  pertechnetate  (sodium \npertechnetate separated from Molybdenum-99 \nby  solvent  extraction  method  was  procured \nfrom Regional center for Radiopharmaceutical \ndivision  [Northern  Region],  Board  of \nRadiation  and  Isotope  Technology,  Delhi, \nIndia. All other chemicals and solvents were \nof analytical reagent grade). 0.1 ml of dipep-\ntide nanostructures (from 1 mg/ml stock) were \nmixed with 0.1 ml of stannous tartarate solu-\ntion (2.5 mg/ml) and the pH was adjusted to \npH7  using  sodium  bicarbonate  solution.  To \nthis  mixture,  1  ml  of  99mTc  (2  mCi/ml)  was \nadded and incubated for 30 min at room tem-\nperature. Quality control was performed as per \nthe method reported earlier  [25]. The labeling \nefficiency of 99mTc with peptide nanostructures \nwas estimated by ascending thin-layer chroma-\ntography (TLC)  using silica gel-coated fiber \nsheets (Gelman Sciences Inc, MI, USA). The \ninstant  TLC  was  performed  using  acetone \nor  0.9%  saline  as  the  mobile  phase.  A  total \nof  2\u20133  \u00b5l  of  the  radio labeled  complex  was \napplied  at  a  point  1  cm  from  one  end  of  an \ninstant-TLC\u2013silica  gel  strip.  The  strip  was \ndeveloped in acetone or 0.9% saline and the \nsolvent front was allowed to reach 8 cm from \nthe origin. The strip was cut into two halves \nand  the  radioactivity  in  each  segment  was \ndetermined in a well-type g-ray counter (g-ray \nspectrophotometer, Type GRS23C, Electronics \nCorporation of India Ltd, Mumbai, India). The \nfree  pertechnetate  that  moved  with  the  sol-\nvent (Rf = 0.9) was determined. The reduced/\nhydrolyzed tech netium along with the labeled \ncomplex remained at the point of application. \nThe amount of reduced/hydrolyzed 99mTc was \ndetermined using saline as the mobile phase. \nThe  reduced/hydrolyzed  99mTc  remained  at \nthe  point  of  application  while  both  the  free \npertechnetate and the labeled complex moved \naway with the solvent front. The net amount of \n99mTc\u2013peptide nanostructures was calculated by \nsubtracting the activity moved with the solvent \nfront using acetone and that when using saline.\nFigure 2.

Purified \npeptides were checked for purity by analytical \nreverse-phase HPLC and were found to be 98% \npure with varying retention times depending \non their physical property  (table  1). Purified \npeptides were further analyzed by MS (table 1).\n \u0084 Self-assembly of \u2206Phe-containing \ndipeptides\nInspired by the self-assembly of Phe\u2013DPhe into \nstable nanotubular structures, we investigated \nthe self-assembling behavior of other DPhe con-\ntaining dipeptides, having positive (Arg), nega-\ntive (Glu), hydrophobic (Lue) or aromatic (Phe) \namino  acids  at  their  N-terminus  (FiguRe  1). \nSelf-assembly of dipeptide nanostructures was \ninitiated by dispersion of 1 mg of peptides in a \nsmall volume (50 \u00b5l) of HFIP and subsequent \naddition of 1 ml of water at near-neutral pH \n(FiguRe 2). Self-assembled structures formed by \ndipeptides Phe\u2013DPhe, Lue\u2013DPhe, were visible \nto the naked eye, whereas those formed by Arg\u2013\nDPhe and Glu\u2013DPhe were not visible (table 2). \nA critical ana lysis revealed that dipeptides \nhaving hydrophobic groups at their N-terminus \nformed visible assemblies whereas those with \nhydrophilic  N-termini  formed  assembled \ns tructures that were not visible to the naked eye. \n \u0084 Electron microscopic studies\nThe morphology of peptide nanostructures was \nascertained using transmission electron micro-\nscopy with uranyl acetate staining  (FiguRe 3). \nAmphiphilic dipeptides such as Glu\u2013DPhe and \nArg\u2013DPhe assembled into vesicular structures \n(table 2 & FiguRe 3). Arg\u2013DPhe, which did not \nshow  any  visible  assembly,  formed  pleomor-\nphic vesicular structures with an average dia-\nmeter of 40 nm at a concentration of 1 mg/ml \n(FiguRe 3). However, the dipeptide Glu\u2013DPhe \nneeded  a  higher  concentration  (5  mg/ml)  to \nform vesicular nanostructures. Vesicles formed \nby  the  dipeptide  were  pleomorphic  with  a \nmean diameter of 110 nm [26]. At a concentra-\ntion of 1 mg/ml, Glu\u2013DPhe formed irregular \nstructures with no proper shape (FiguRe 3). As \nreported earlier, Phe\u2013DPhe, which has an addi-\ntional aromatic group, formed ordered nano-\ntubes [23] with a mean diameter of 15\u201320 nm \nand length in microns where as the dipeptide \nLeu\u2013DPh"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"peptide_sequence\": \"RF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"vesicle\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"Delta-F\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"5/95 HFP/H2O\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"1.0\", \"PH\": \"4.8\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"Yes\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"2160.0\"}, {\"peptide_sequence\": \"EF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"vesicle\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"Delta-F\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"5/95 HFP/H2O\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"5.0\", \"PH\": \"4.8\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"Yes\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"2160.0\"}, {\"peptide_sequence\": \"FF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"tube\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"Delta-F\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"5/95 HFP/H2O\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"1.0\", \"PH\": \"4.8\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"Yes\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"2160.0\"}]"}]}

The structures of Fmoc-YL microcapsules\nwere determined by Hitachi S800 field emission scanning elec-\ntron microscope (SEM) at an accelerating voltage of 10 keV.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "polypeptide self-assembly literature information extraction"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Self-assembly of aromatic peptide amphiphiles is known to be driven by a \ncombination of \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking of the aromatic moieties and hydrogen bonding \nbetween the peptide backbones, with possible stabilisation from the amino acid \nside chains. Phenylalanine-based Fmoc-dipeptides have previously been reported \nfor their characteristic apparent pKa transitions, which were shown to coincide \nwith significant structural and morphological changes that were peptide sequence \ndependent. Here, phenylalanine was replaced by leucine and the effect on the \nself-assembling behaviour of Fmoc-dipeptides was measured using potentiometry, \nfluorescence and infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray \nscattering and shear rheometry. This study provides additional cues towards the \nelucidation of the sequence-structure relationship in self-assembling aromatic \npeptide amphiphiles.\n\nMaterials: All Fmoc-dipeptides were purchased from C S\nBio Company (Menlo Park, USA) and used without fur-\nther puri\ufb01cation. The purity of the compounds was ver-\ni\ufb01ed by HPLC (> 98%) and mass spectrometry. HPLC\ngrade water and deuterated water (99.9 atom% D) were\npurchased from Merck and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively.\nSample preparation: Depending on the desired concen-\ntration, the required amount of Fmoc-dipeptide was sus-\npended into 2 mL of HPLC grade water. Sodium hydroxide\n(0.5 M) was gradually added to the aqueous suspensions\nof Fmoc-dipeptide until pH 10.5 was reached (\u223c 55 \u03bcL\nfor 10 mmol L\u22121 sample). The samples were vortexed and\nsonicated for one minute to fully dissolve the peptide am-\nphiphiles. Depending on the concentration and on the\ntarget pH, a required volume of dilute hydrochloric acid\n(0.085 M) was then added dropwise while the solution was\nvortexed and sonicated until the target pH was obtained.\nNext, the samples were heated to 75\u201380 \u25e6C until fully dis-\nsolved (1.0, 2.5 and 1.5 minutes for Fmoc-LL, Fmoc-LG\nand Fmoc-GL, respectively) and homogenised. The sam-\nples were subsequently cooled and maintained at 4 \u25e6C for\n\u223c 12 hours (overnight) to promote or maintain gelation.\nTo allow comparison between the studied samples, all were\ninvestigated after this same aging time. Reported pH val-\nues were those measured after storage. They were found\nto be identical to the pH values measured before heating\nwithin \u00b10.3 units.\nPotentiometry: pH measurements were performed using\na Hanna Instruments pH210 pH-meter equipped with\na Hamilton Spintrode pH-probe (reference system: Ag/\nAgCl, electrolyte: 3 M KCl, diaphragm: ceramic, sensi-\ntivity: 58 mV/pH unit at 25 \u25e6C). The pH-meter was cali-\nbrated before each experiment to check the response of the\nelectrode with two bu\ufb00er solutions purchased from Fisher\nScienti\ufb01c: phthalate pH 4.01 and phosphate pH 7.01 bu\ufb00er\nsolutions.\n\u201cTitration\u201d experiments: The 5, 10 and 20 mmol L\u22121 sam-\nples at pH 10.5 were prepared as described above. For\n1 mmol L\u22121 samples, 5 mmol L\u22121 samples at pH 10.5 were\nused as stock solutions and diluted to the desired con-\ncentration in a \ufb01nal volume of 2 mL. The pH of the \ufb01-\nnal solutions was then adjusted to pH 10.5. The \u201ctitra-\ntion\u201d experiments were performed by stepwise addition of\nsmall volumes of diluted HCl (0.085 M; 2\u201360 \u03bcL depend-\ning on pH and system), up to a total added volume of\n750 \u03bcL. After each addition the samples were heated to\n75\u201380 \u25e6C for one minute, vortexed, sonicated, and subse-\nquently cooled back to room temperature using a water\nbath. pH values were recorded before and after heating of\nthe samples. The samples were deemed fully mixed when\nno signi\ufb01cant di\ufb00erence (\u00b10.3 pH unit) was observed be-\ntween two pH measurements. Due to the strong and con-\nstant agitation applied, samples were liquid at all times\nduring the \u201ctitration\u201d experiments. As a control, water\nwas also titrated using the same methodology described\nabove; that is, NaOH was added to the water in order to\nbring the pH of the solution to 10.5 and then HCl was\nadded stepwise. Experiments, including the characterisa-\ntion experiments described below, were repeated a least 3\ntimes to ensure reproducibility.\novernight. Emission and excitation slit widths were set at\n3 and 10 nm, respectively. Emission spectra (excitation at\n265 nm) were acquired at 25 \u25e6C in the 300\u2013600 nm range\nwith a scan speed of 300 nm min\u22121 using FL WinLab soft-\nware. Changes in the pH conditions and therefore in the\nself-assembled structures formed are likely to modify the\nrefractive index of the samples and the quenching e\ufb00ect\nresulting from self-assembly. These e\ufb00ects would have a di-\nrect e\ufb00ect on the intensity of the transmitted light hence\non the emission peaks\u2019 intensity. For this reason, \ufb02uores-\ncence spectra were all normalised as a function of their\nrespective maximum emission peak. The un-normalised\nspectra are presented in the supplementary material.\nFourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR): Multiple\nbounce attenuated total re\ufb02ectance (ATR) FTIR experi-\nments were undertaken using samples prepared in deuter-\nated water. Spectra were recorded on a Thermo Nicolet\n5700 spectrometer equipped with a trough plate compris-\ning of a zinc selenide crystal, which permitted 12 re\ufb02ec-\ntions with a 45\u25e6 angle of incidence. The samples were\nspread directly on the surface of the trough plate. Spec-\ntra were acquired in the 4000\u2013400 cm\u22121 range with a res-\nolution of 4 cm\u22121 over 128 scans. The deuterated water\nspectrum was used as background and subtracted from all\nspectra (software used: Omnic version 7.2, Thermo Elec-\ntron Corporation).\nMechanical properties: Mechanical properties were as-\nsessed using a stress-controlled rheometer (Bohlin C-\nVOR) equipped with a Peltier device (Bohlin Instru-\nments) to control temperature using a parallel-plate ge-\nometry (40 mm diameter). To ensure the measurements\nwere made in the linear regime, amplitude sweeps were\nperformed and showed no variation in G(cid:3) and G(cid:3)(cid:3) up to\na strain of 1%. The dynamic moduli of the hydrogel were\nmeasured as a function of frequency in the range 0.01\u2013\n100 rad s\u22121 with a strain of 1%. To keep the sample hy-\ndrated, a solvent trap was used and the atmosphere within\nthe sample chamber was saturated with water. Unless oth-\nerwise stated the experiments were performed at 25 \u25e6C\nand repeated at least three times (each time on new sam-\nples) to ensure reproducibility. The standard deviation of\nmultiple experiments is represented by error bars in the\ndynamic frequency sweeps.\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) and image anal-\nysis: A carbon-coated copper grid (400 mesh, Agar Scien-\nti\ufb01c) was glow discharged for 30 seconds then placed on\n10 \u03bcL of sample for 15 seconds. After blotting on What-\nman 50 \ufb01lter paper, the loaded grid was washed in double\ndistilled water for 30 seconds and blotted. The sample\nwas then stained with 10 \u03bcL of 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate\n(centrifuged for 5 minutes beforehand) for one minute and\nblotted for 10 seconds. Data were collected at high vac-\nuum on a JEOL 1220 transmission electron microscope\nconnected to a high resolution (up to 3 \u02daA/pixel resolution)\nGatan Orius CCD camera."}, {"role":

This hydrogel material has been charac-\nterized using \ufb01eld emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-\ntransmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier\ntransformed infrared spectroscopy, di\ufb00erential\ncalorimetric, X-ray di\ufb00raction (XRD), and rheological studies.\nFE-SEM and TEM studies have revealed the formation of a\nnano\ufb01brillar network structure upon gelation. Thiol (-SH)\ncontaining ligands (amino acid/peptide) have been used to\nstabilize small silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), and these thiol-capped silver nanoparticles have been incorporated into this hydrogel\nto prepare hybrid hydrogels. Morphological study of silver nanoparticles containing a hybrid hydrogel (using TEM experiments)\nhas indicated the nice fabrication of AgNPs along the gel nano\ufb01bers. Fabrication of nanoparticles upon the gel nano\ufb01bers is due\nto noncovalent interactions between the capping ligands of the nanoparticles and the peptide-based hydrogel nano\ufb01bers.\nRheological investigations of these hybrid hydrogels have shown the weakening of the mechanical strength of the hydrogel after\nincorporation of AgNPs within the native hydrogel system. Our studies have vividly shown the dependence of the elastic\nmodulus (G\u2032) and yield stress (\u03c3\ny) on three factors: (a) the nature of the stabilizing ligands used for AgNPs, (b) the size of the\nAgNPs, and (c) the amount of AgNPs used for the preparation of hybrid hydrogel systems. Modulation of the mechanical\nstrength of the hybrid hydrogel can be successfully achieved by varying these above-mentioned factors. This modulation of the\nmechanical properties keeps a future promise to make tunable soft materials with interesting properties.\nFormation of supramolecular gels1\u221218 from small organic\nmolecules has attracted signi\ufb01cant research interest over the\npast several years. Low molecular weight gelators are self-\nassembled using di\ufb00erent kinds of noncovalent interactions\nincluding \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic, ionic,\nvan der Waals, and others to form gels.1\u221218 Hydrogel formation\nhas often been triggered by di\ufb00erent kinds of external stimuli,\nsuch as enzymes,19,20 pH,21,22 solvents,23\u221225 metal ions,26,27 salt\nconcentrations,28,29 and others. Adams and co-workers have\nrecently developed a new technique to trigger the hydro-\ngelation of several short peptides utilizing the hydrolysis of\nglucono-\u03b4-lactone by controlling the pH of\ndium.30,31Hydrogel materials have been extensively studied\nowing to their potent applications in vast areas,\nincluding\nsustained release of drugs and bioactive molecules,24,32\u221234\nsca\ufb00olds for tissue growth,35,36 repair and wound healing,37\ncatalysis of organic reactions,38 pollutant\nwastewater,39\u221241 and others. Hamley42\u221244and co-workers have\nstudied the self-assembly and hydrogelation of several model\nshort peptide sequences of the amyloidal \u03b2-peptide.\nConstruction of a nanohybrid system using gel nano\ufb01bers\nand inorganic nanomaterials has become an active area of\ncurrent research.45\u221259 Our research group has been involved in\nthe discovery and development of peptide-based supra-\nmolecular gels11,24,39,40,47,48,59,63,64 and preparation of\ngel-based di\ufb00erent nanohybrid systems.11,47,48 Incorporation of\ndi\ufb00erent nanomaterials into the supramolecular gel matrix can\na\ufb00ect and modulate the properties of the native gel.45\u221258 The\nhybrid gel can exhibit physicochemical properties that are\ninteresting and di\ufb00erent from that of the native gel. There are\nseveral reports on the modulation of the mechanical property of\ngel phase materials by incorporating di\ufb00erent nanomaterials,\nincluding nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, graphene, metal\nions, and others.11,26\u221229,50\u221258\nAn increase in the inorganic salt concentration has also\ntriggered the tuning of the mechanical strength of gel phase\nmaterials.26\u221229 Inclusion of metal ions (coming from inorganic\nsalts) generally screens the negative charge of carboxylate\ngroups of the corresponding gelator in gelation, and this assists\nin the formation of a more rigid gel system.27 Previously,\nBhattacharya and co-workers examined the mechanical strength\nof hybrid gels by incorporating di\ufb00erent ligand-capped gold\nnanoparticles into the native organogel matrix.52,53 They\nreported that incorporation of gold nanoparticles into the gel\nmatrix initially enhanced the rigidity of the hybrid gel. Then,\nrigidity of the hybrid gel was diminished with a further increase\nin the concentration of nanoparticles. According to them, the\norganization of\nthe gel materials was perturbed in the\naccommodation of an increased number of nanoparticles, and\nas a consequence of that, gel rigidity was decreased.\nGuerzo and co-workers51 have also demonstrated that the\nsti\ufb00ness of anthracene-based organogel has been gradually\ndecreased upon the incorporation of long-chain thiol-capped\ngold nanoparticles. Han and co-workers showed that\nincorporation of a graphene sheet into the copolymer-based\nhydrogel remarkably diminished the elastic modulus (G\u2032);\nviscous modulus (G\u2033); and \ufb01nally, the strength of the gel.57\nIn the course of our investigation on self-assembly and\ngelation of peptide based molecules,11,24,39,40,47,48,59,63 an N-\nterminally protected tripeptide (Boc-Phe-Phe-Ala\u2212OH) has\nbeen discovered to form a translucent, self-supporting gel in a\nbasic aqueous medium. Moreover, silver nanoparticles contain-\ning hybrid hydrogels have been prepared by incorporating\ndi\ufb00erent cysteine-based-ligand-capped AgNPs into the native\nhydrogel. Although the gel strength can be easily tunable by\nvarying the gelator concentration,65 in this study, we are curious\nto investigate an alternative way to modulate the gel strength\nwithout changing the concentration of the gelator. In this\nregard, AgNP-containing hybrid gels have been prepared to\naddress the point, whether gel strength can be modulated by\nthe incorporation of AgNPs into the hybrid gel, and if yes, to\n\ufb01nd out the factors that are responsible for governing the\nmodulation of the gel strength using rheological experiments.\nRheological investigations reveal that the mechanical strength\nof the hybrid hydrogel depends on the nature of the capping\nligands of the silver nanoparticles, the size of the nanoparticles,\nand the amount of nanoparticles added into the native gel.\nMaterials. L-Phenylalanine, L-alanine, L-cysteine, L-leucine,\nformic acid (HCOOH), Boc anhydride, N,N\u2032-dicyclohexylcar-\nbodiimide (DCC), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), sodium\nborohydride (NaBH4), silver nitrate (AgNO3), and triphenyl\nmethanol were purchased from Sigma Chemicals. All other\ncommon solvents were purchased from SRL, India.\nGelator Peptide (Boc-Phe-Phe-Ala\u2212OH). Boc-Phe-Phe-\nAla\u2212OMe (6.39 g, 15.0 mmol) was dissolved in 20 mL of\nMeOH, and then 10 mL of 1 M NaOH was added. The\nreaction mixture was\nthen stirred, and the progress of\nsaponi\ufb01cation was monitored by thin layer chromatography.\nAfter 10 h, the methanol was removed under vacuum, the\nresidue was placed in 50 mL of water and washed with diethyl\nether (2 \u00d7 50 mL).

Dipeptides were synthesized by conventional\nsolution phase methodology by using the racemization-free\nfragment condensation strategy (Scheme S1, Supporting\nInformation). The N-terminus was protected by the Boc\ngroup, the C-terminus was protected as a methyl ester, and the\nthiol (\u2212SH) group was protected by the trityl group. Couplings\nwere mediated by DCC/HOBt. Deprotection of the methyl\nester was performed using the saponi\ufb01cation method,\ndeprotection of the Boc was performed by HCOOH, and\ndeprotection of the trityl group was performed by treatment\nwith AgNO3 in the presence of pyridine. All compounds were\ncharacterized by mass spectrometry (HRMS) and 1H NMR\nspectroscopy (300 MHz).\nHydrogel Preparation. A requisite amount of gelator\npeptide was taken in a screw-capped glass vial. Aqueous NaOH\nsolution was then added into that glass vial. This resultant\nmixture was heated until the gelator molecules were dissolved\ncompletely, and this upon cooling at room temperature for 2\nmin gave a self-supported translucent hydrogel. This hydrogel is\nstable over 15 days at room temperature without any visual\nField Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-\nSEM). FE-SEM experiments were performed by placing a small\nportion of gel samples on a microscope cover glass. These\nsamples were then dried \ufb01rst in air and then in vacuum and\ncoated with platinum for 90 s at 10 kV voltages and 10 \u03bcA\ncurrent. The thickness of the coating layer of platinum was 3\u22124\nnm. After that, micrographs were taken by using a SEM\napparatus, Jeol scanning microscope JSM-6700F.\nTransmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Morpholo-\ngies of native and hybrid hydrogels were studied using TEM\nexperiments. A drop of dilute solution of the gel-phase material\nof the corresponding gel was placed on carbon coated copper\ngrids (300 mesh) and dried by slow evaporation. Each grid was\nthen allowed to dry in a vacuum at 30 \u00b0C for two days. Images\nwere taken with an FEI (Tecnai Spirit) instrument.\nCongo Red Binding Study. A 2.0% (w/v) hydrogel was\nprepared, and Congo red solution (1 mmol) was added into the\ngel vial. Congo red-stained hydrogel was then prepared by a\nheating\u2212cooling cycle. This hydrogel was allowed to age for 1\nday, and a small piece of the gel was taken out in a spatula, and\nthis gel was placed on a glass side upon shearing. Excess dye\nwas removed by washing using distilled water, then the sample\nwas dried in vacuum at room temperature for 24 h. The dried\nX-ray Di\ufb00raction Study. Hydrogel was prepared at a\nconcentration of 3.0% (w/v), and it was then subjected to\nlyophilization to obtain the xerogel sample. X-ray di\ufb00raction\nstudy of this xerogel was carried out by placing the sample on a\nglass plate. The experiment was carried out by using an X-ray\ndi\ufb00ractometer (Bruker AXS, model no. D8 Advance). The\ninstrument was operated at a 40 kV voltage and 40 mA current\nusing Ni-\ufb01ltered Cu K\u03b1 radiation, and the instrument was\ncalibrated with a standard Al2O3 (corundum) sample before\nuse. For 5\u221230\u00b0 scans, the LynxEye super speed detector was\nused with scan speed 0.3 s and step size 0.02\u00b0.\nDi\ufb00erential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Thermal\nbehavior of the gel was studied using a Perkin-Elmer di\ufb00erential\nscanning calorimeter (Diamond DSC-7) working under N2\natmosphere. The gel sample was taken in a large volume\ncapsule (LVC) tightly sealed with an O-ring. It was then heated\nfrom 20 to 90 \u00b0C at a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C/min. A cooling run\nwas also taken after waiting 10 min at 90 \u00b0C, and then the\nsample was cooled to 20 \u00b0C at a rate of 2 \u00b0C/min. The\ninstrument was calibrated with indium and cyclohexane.\nFT-IR Study. FT-IR spectra were recorded using a Nicolate\n380 FT-IR spectrophotometer (Thermo Scienti\ufb01c). The FT-IR\nspectrum of the gelator in solid and xerogel state (obtained\nfrom 3.0% (w/v) hydrogel) were recorded using the KBr disk\ntechnique. Xerogel was dissolved in D2O to get the hydrogel\n(3.0%, w/v), and this wet gel was used for the FT-IR study\nusing a CaF2 cell.\nRheology.

Among them, nanotubes of \ndiphenylalanine (FF) and its analogues have been one of the most studied \nstructures in the last few years. Their importance originates from the need to \nbetter understand the formation of \u03b2-amyloid fibrils which are associated with \nAlzheimer's disease. In this work, the FF self-assembly process was probed using \ntime-resolved Raman microscopy. The changes in the Raman spectra are followed \nover time after injecting water into a FF-film until micro/nanotubes (MNTs) are \nformed. Specific features of the Raman spectra clearly suggest that FF-molecules \nafter water injection form an intermediate species before forming FF-MNTs. The \nbroad Raman bands observed for the intermediate species suggest the presence of \nvery heterogeneous structures based on FF. The FF-MNTs appear almost \ninstantaneously (detected via the rise of the typical Raman bands of FF-MNTs at \n761, 1249 and 1426 cm-1) after the intermediate structures are formed. This \ndelayed formation of FF-MNTs supports a nucleation process. The formation via \nnucleation of FF-MNTs is further corroborated by a simulation of the Raman \nspectra based on a 2-step kinetic model and the respective vibrational Raman \nmodes are identified using Density Functional Theory vibrational calculations. \nOur results indicate that the driving force for the FF-MNT patterning process is \nthe electric dipole re-orientation originating from the FF dipeptide unit \nconnectivity over time.\n\nThe lyophilized form of L-diphenylalanine (FF) was purchased\nfrom Bachem and the 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP)\nsolvent from Sigma Aldrich.

The properties of NPs, including size, shape, \nand surface functionality, play a decisive role in these interactions. Herein, \nwe evaluated the influences of gold NPs (AuNPs) with different sizes (5-60 nm) \nand shapes (i.e., spherical, rod, and cage) on the self-assembly of \ndiphenylalanine (Phe-Phe) dipeptides. We found that the size of AuNPs smaller \nthan 10 nm did not affect the self-assembly process of Phe-Phe, while bigger \nAuNPs (>10 nm) caused the formation of starlike peptide morphologies connected \nto one center. In the case of shape differences, nanorod and nanocage \nmorphologies acted differently than spherical ones and caused the formation of \ndensely packed, networklike dipeptide morphologies. In addition to these \nexperiments, by combining photothermal properties of AuNPs with a Phe-Phe-based \norganogel having a thermo-responsive property, we demonstrated that the \ndegelation process of AuNPs embedded organogels may be controlled by laser \nillumination. Complete degelation was achieved in about 10 min. We believe that \nsuch control may open the door to new opportunities for a number of \napplications, such as controlled release of drugs and tissue engineering.\n\nSynthesis of Gold Nanoparticles. The 5 nm AuNPs were\nprepared through the well-established reduction reaction.44 Brie\ufb02y, a\n10 mL aqueous solution containing 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 M HAuCl4 and 2.5 \u00d7\n10\u22124 M trisodium citrate was \ufb01rst prepared. While stirring, ice-cooled\n0.3 mL of 0.1 M sodium borohydride was added to this solution. The\ncolor change in the solution was an indication of\nthe particle\nformation. The nanoparticles were used within 2\u22123 h.\nThe 10\u221260 nm gold nanoparticles were also synthesized as follows:\nto 49 mL of deionized water was added 1 mL of 12.7 mM aqueous\nHAuCl4 solution. The mixture was heated to boiling while stirring.\nAfterward, di\ufb00erent amounts of 38.8 M trisodium citrate solution\n(200\u2212600 \u03bcL) were added to the boiling mixture. After cooling to\nroom temperature, the samples were centrifuged and washed with DI\nwater several times and dispersed in ethanol.\nPreparation of Gold Nanorods. The Au nanorods (AuNRs)\nwere synthesized by a three-step seeding method described by Murphy\nand co-workers.45 In the \ufb01rst step, 0.5 mL of 0.01 M HAuCl4 was\nadded to 20 mL of 0.1 M cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB).\nNext, 1.2 mL of ice-cold 0.1 M sodium borohydride was added to the\nmixture all at once. The solution was vigorously stirred at 25 \u00b0C for 5\nmin. The brownish color indicates the seed formation. The solution\nwas then used for the synthesis of gold nanorods within 20 min of its\nsynthesis. In the second step, a 54 mL growth solution containing 10\u22124\nM HAuCl4 with 0.1 M CTAB was prepared. Afterward, three \ufb02asks\neach containing 18 mL growth solution was labeled as I, II, or III. To\nthese \ufb02asks were added 0.1 mL of 0.1 M ascorbic acid and stirred\ngently. A 2.0 mL of seed solution was then mixed with \ufb02ask I. Next, 2.0\nmL of solution I was added to \ufb02ask II. Finally, 2 mL of solution II was\nmixed with solution III. The synthesized nanorods were centrifuged\nand washed with water several times to remove excess CTAB.\nSynthesis of Gold Nanocages. The Au nanocages (AuNCs)\nwere synthesized by the galvanic replacement reaction between silver\n(Ag) nanocubes and chloroauric acid (HAuCl4). In the \ufb01rst step, Ag\nnanocubes were synthesized by a previously described protocol.46\nAfterward, a \ufb01xed amount of Ag nanocubes was dispersed in water\ncontaining poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) in a \ufb02ask under magnetic\nstirring and then heated to a boil for 10 min. A 3 mL 0.2 mM HAuCl4\naqueous solution was added to the \ufb02ask through a syringe pump under\nmagnetic stirring. The solution was heated for another 10 min until the\nthe system was stable. Once cooled down to room\ntemperature, the sample was centrifuged and washed with saturated\nNaCl solution to remove AgCl and with water several times to remove\nPVP and NaCl before characterization by TEM and UV\u2212vis.\nSelf-Assembly of Dipeptides. 2.0 mg of lyophilized diphenyla-\nlanine dipeptide (Phe\u2212Phe; Bachem AG, Switzerland) was \ufb01rst\ndissolved in 0.9 mL of ethanol at 70 \u00b0C for 10 min and then cooled to\nroom temperature. To the peptide solution was then added 100 \u03bcL\naliquot amounts of AuNPs (i.e., spherical, rod, or cage) dispersed in\nethanol. After 3\u22124 h, each peptide\u2212AuNP mixture (100 \u03bcL) was\nplaced onto a glass slide or silicon wafer surfaces and dried at ambient\ntemperature, until the solvent evaporated. The resultant dipeptide\nstructures were characterized by SEM.\nPreparation of Organogels. For organogel fabrication, we used\nPhe\u2212Phe dipeptides, which have no protecting group or any end\nfunctionalization, as a building block. Typical Phe\u2212Phe organogels\nwith or without AuNPs were fabricated as follows: a 0.40 M stock\nPhe\u2212Phe solution was \ufb01rst prepared in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexa\ufb02uoro-2-\npropanol (HFIP) and then diluted by AuNPs containing chloroform\n(3.0 \u00d7 1010 to 5.6 \u00d7 1011 particles/mL) to give a \ufb01nal concentration of\n8.0 mM. We chose HFIP/chloroform solvent medium for\nfabrication of organogels because our Phe\u2212Phe dipeptides do not\nhave any side chain or end group to promote gelation in a water\nmedium. In general, HFIP is often used to dissolve Phe\u2212Phe and then\ninitiate the molecular self-assembly in the organic phase (i.e., toluene\nand chloroform). The AuNPs (\u223c20 nm) were synthesized, as\nmentioned above. Subsequently, an organogel network having\nAuNPs was rapidly formed. Plain organogels were also obtained in\nthe same manner without using AuNPs. Laser-triggered degelation of\nAuNPs containing organogels was investigated by using a green laser\nat a power density of 50 mW/cm2 with a wavelength of 532 nm.\nCharacterizations. All peptide morphologies and fabricated\norganogels were characterized by a JEOL JSM-6060 scanning electron\nmicroscope (SEM) with an acceleration voltage of 10 kV after the\nsamples were coated with a thin layer of gold. A Fourier transform\ninfrared (FTIR) spectrometer (Thermo Nicolet IR) operated under an\nattenuated total re\ufb02ection mode was also used to collect spectra of the\npeptide samples. The IR spectra were recorded with a 4 cm\u22121\nresolution. Thermogravimetric measurements of organogels with and\nwithout AuNPs were also carried out using a SII 7300 Exstar thermal\nanalyzer. Samples were heated from room temperature to 350 \u00b0C at a\nconstant rate of 2 \u00b0C/min under N2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"peptide_sequence\": \"FF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"organogel\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"2/98 HFP/Chloroform\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"2.5\", \"PH\": \"7.0\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"nan\"}"}]}

A number\nof studies have shown that generalized phase diagrams can\nbe used to understand the general features of a binary\nmixture of solute and solvent.1\u20133 In some systems, however,\nit is not clear whether phase separation is determined pri-\nmarily by thermodynamics or kinetics.4\u20137 In the thermo-\ndynamic limit, if solute molecules are assumed to experi-\nence a net attraction of \u03b5, a phase diagram could be devel-\noped where kT/\u03b5 (experimentally characterized by measur-\ning solute secondary virial coe\ufb03cients and solute self-\ndi\ufb00usivity)8\u201312 is plotted as a function of solute volume\nfraction (Fig. 1). These generalized phase diagrams have\nbeen shown to be useful predictors of solubility of small\nmolecules, proteins and colloids, and, surprisingly, capture\nsolubilities even when the molecules have very anisotropic\ninteractions.10\u201312 The general nature of the proposed phase\ndiagram suggests that at the same value of \u03b5/kT, di\ufb00erent\nsolutes will have the same solubility. Solvent\u2013solute inter-\nactions play a key role in establishing the magnitude of\n\u03b5/kT. These attractions are often broken down into polar,\ndispersion and hydrogen bonding interactions. The relative\nSelf-assembling gelators based on short peptide derivative\nmolecules form ordered fibrous structures, commonly via \u03c0\u2013\u03c0\nstacking and hydrogen bonding interactions.13\u201322 The result-\ning bulk properties of the produced materials are characteristic\nof soft solids. The most widely studied such gelator molecule\nis fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-diphenylalanine (Fmoc-FF).13\u201321\nLow-concentration solutions of Fmoc-FF form gels of substan-\ntial elastic moduli when mixed with water. Because of their\nflexibility for altering chemical composition, Fmoc-FF and\nsimilar short peptide derivative gelators show promise for a\nhost of uses including tissue engineering, nanofabrication,\nbiosensing.23\u201327\nHowever, the design of new gelator molecules with desired\nself-assembly properties is limited by the lack of understand-\ning of the gelation mechanism. Hence, these low molecular\nweight gelators are less often designed than they are\ndiscovered.\nWe have previously shown that gelation of Fmoc-FF in\nDMSO solutions triggered by addition of water results from a\nfirst order phase transition giving rise to elongated crystals of\nhigh aspect ratios.21 Detailed studies indicate that increasing\nthe concentration of water increases the strength of attraction\n\u03b5/kT, leading to fast nucleation rates and quasi-one-dimen-\nsional crystal growth.21 If this is done with su\ufb03cient rapidity,\nthe mixture will lie below the spinodal and large amorphous\ndroplets will form, which over time re-dissolve, nucleate and\ngrow crystals in coexistence with a dilute solution.\nHowever, the type of solvent can impact the molecular\npacking of crystals formed when the solidus is crossed. As we\nshow here, solvent\u2013solute interactions determine the self-\nassembly pathway and structure stability, and therefore play a\ncrucial role in shaping the energy landscape and phase behav-\nior of dipeptide gelators. Understanding these interactions is\nnecessary not only for developing guidelines for adequate\nsolvent environments for existing gelators, but moreover for\ngeneralizing the design rules for novel self-assembling mole-\ncules. In addition, widely studied peptides such as A\u03b2-42, the\nAlzheimer\u2019s peptide and initial inspiration for study of Fmoc-\nFF, yield highly polymorphic assemblies. Polymorphism in\nthese systems is assumed to be the result of kinetic trapping,\nrather than relaxation to thermodynamic equilibrium. Hence,\nFmoc-FF may present us with an opportunity to not only shed\nlight upon a highly versatile biomaterial, but to also a near-\nequilibrium, self-assembled structure of an amino acid motif\nthought to be crucial to the self-assembly of A\u03b2-42.\nWith the exception of a few notable studies, the role of sol-\nvents in dipeptide gelation has been largely overlooked in the\nliterature. Raeburn et al. investigated gels of Fmoc-FF in four\ndi\ufb00erent solvents mixed with water, reporting their obser-\nvations on the resulting mechanical properties.28 Wang et al.\ninvestigated the role of solvent-bridged hydrogen bonding in\nfiber formation of diphenylalanine (FF).29 Ramos Sasselli et al.\nhave developed a simple packing model based on solvophobi-\ncity of amphiphilic molecules to determine the thermo-\ndynamic favorability of fiber stability and applied it to pH-trig-\ngered gelation of Fmoc-FF. Previous studies highlighting fiber\nversus crystal formation have focused on the structure of\ndi\ufb00erent gelator molecules in a fixed system31,32 ( pH-triggered\ngelation in aqueous solution); here, we instead explore the\nphase behavior of one molecule in a variety of solvent systems\nwith the aim of understanding what drives the formation of\nfibrous gels. While many studies have focused only on biocom-\npatible hydrogels, we employ a multitude of solvents with a\nrange of di\ufb00erent interaction types, mainly in order to recog-\nnize how these interactions lead to specific phase behavior\nand stability, as well as to develop guidelines for applications\nthat do not require cell-friendly solvents.\nThe larger the value of R, the less soluble A will be in\nB. Estimated solubility parameters can be calculated based on\ngroup contributions of the molecule.33,34 Experimentally, they\nare established by finding a number of solvents in which the\nsubstance is soluble or insoluble, plotting their coordinates in\nHansen space, and determining a sphere that encompasses as\nmany solvents as possible in which the solute dissolves. The\ncoordinates of the center of that solubility sphere are then con-\nsidered to be the HSPs of the solute.33,35 Outside of the solubi-\nlity sphere, other domains containing information about\nphase behavior can be established.36\u201341 We employ this\napproach to study the phase behavior of Fmoc-FF and interpret\nthe solvent\u2013solute interactions present in the system. Three\nsolvent systems (DMSO/H2O, methanol/H2O, and toluene) are\nselected to illustrate distinct phase behavior and highlight\nstructural di\ufb00erences. Our findings indicate that:\n(2) Fmoc-FF exhibits distinct polymorphism in certain\nsolvent systems, where it can transition from a metastable an-\nisotropic crystalline structure (fibers) to large crystal aggre-\ngates with no preferred axis of growth.\nAll non-NMR samples were prepared at a fixed Fmoc-FF con-\n\u22121 (minimum concentration to ensure\ncentration of 15 mg mL\na su\ufb03cient signal in the CPMAS NMR measurements). The\nappropriate mass of the solid peptide was added to 1 mL of\nsolvent and vortex-mixed. In some cases, the suspension was\nheated (to no more than 75 \u00b0C) to facilitate dissolution. If\nFmoc-FF did not form a clear solution at this temperature, the\nbehavior in the given solvent was labeled as \u201cinsoluble\u201d. The\nheated solutions were allowed to cool back to room tempera-\nture and left to stand overnight, after which the phase behavior\nwas noted. For ternary systems, the desired mass of Fmoc-FF\nwas first fully dissolved in the solvent, followed by addition of\nthe appropriate amount water, and left to stand overnight.\nNMR samples were allowed to self-assemble in the following\nsolvent systems: DMSO/H2O (xH2O = 0.95), methanol/H2O\n(xH2O = 0.95 and xH2O = 0.20), pure methanol (no H2O), and\npure toluene. Each sample was prepared at a concentration of\n\u22121, with the exception of the sample in pure metha-\nnol, which was prepared at approximately 300 mg mL\nA small amount (40 ppm) of Nile Blue fluorescent dye was\nadded to the solution. Immediately upon mixing the solution\nwith water, 50 \u00b5L of the mixture was transferred into a glass\nbottom dish (MatTek Corp.) and covered with a lid. The\nsample was loaded onto a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope\nand images were taken using a 63\u00d7 magnification oil immer-\nsion objective at 639 nm excitation wavelength. In the case of\nsolvents in which the dye was insoluble (apolar solvents such\nas benzene and toluene), the peptide was pre-dyed. This pro-\ncedure involved dissolving the Fmoc-FF and dye in a highly\nvolatile solvent\n(acetone) and heating the solution under\nvacuum until all the solvent had evaporated. The dyed solid\npowder was then dissolved in the desired apolar solvent.\nA 15 \u03bcL droplet of the solution was transferred onto a glass\nsurface, before the onset of gel transition. A 400 mesh carbon\ncoated copper grid (SPI Supplies) was placed on the sample\ndroplet for 30 s and the excess liquid was removed. The grid\nwas then washed and placed on a 15 \u03bcL droplet of ammonium\nmolybdate solution for 60 s. The excess stain was washed and\nthe sample grid was stored covered overnight. Images were col-\nlected using JEOL 2100 Cryo and JEOL 2010 LaB6 transmission\nelectron microscopes operating at 200 kV.\nAll NMR experiments were performed on a 500 MHz (11.75 T)\nBruker NMR spectrometer. All samples were prepared as\ndescribed previously and lyophilized. We used 1H\u201313C cross\npolarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) solid-state NMR to\nprobe the natural abundance 13C populations of Fmoc-FF\nassemblies.42 The shapes and linewidths of CPMAS NMR\nsignals can be used to assess the overall level of molecular\norder. The peaks from the Fmoc group were identified by\nrunning CPMAS on two samples assembled in DMSO/H2O\n(xH2O = 0.95), one of which was uniformly labeled with 13C iso-\ntopes on the two phenylalanine residues (see Fig. S1, ESI\u2020).\nEach sample was packed into a 3.2 mm Bruker NMR rotor. The\nmagic angle spinning speed for each experiment was 20 kHz.\nA 2 ms 1H\u201313C CP spinlock was applied concurrently with a 50\nkHz radio frequency field on the 13C channel and linear ramp\npulse between 60 and 120 kHz on the 1H channel. During\nsignal acquisition, a 100 kHz 1H decoupling pulse was applied\nusing two pulse phase modulation (TPPM).43 Each spectrum\nwas collected over the course of 12\u201315 hours of signal aver-\naging time with a recycle delay of 5 s. The NMR chemical\nshifts were referenced to adamantane.

Other tripeptide hydrogelators with chemical structures of Nap-FFX \n(X = A, K, S, or E) could not or possessed less potencies to inhibit platelet \naggregations. We observed higher amounts of Nap-FFG at the platelet surface by \nthe techniques of LC-MS and confocal microscopy. We also observed self-assembled \nnanofibers around the platelet incubated with the Nap-FFG by cryo-TEM. The \u03b6 \npotential of Nap-FFG treated platelets was a little bit more negative than that \nof untreated ones. The amount of Nap-FFG at the surface of NIH 3T3 cells was \nmuch less than that of platelets. These observations suggested that Nap-FFG \ncould selectively self-assemble through unknown ligand-receptor interactions and \nform thin layers of hydrogels at the surface of platelets, thus preventing the \naggregation of them. This study not only broadened the application and opened up \na new door for biomedical applications of molecular hydrogels but also might \nprovide a novel strategy to counteract infection diseases through selective \nsurface-induced hydrogelations at pathogens, such as bacteria and virus.\n\nChemicals and Materials.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "polypeptide self-assembly literature information extraction"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Self-assembled synthetic materials are typically disordered, and controlling the \nalignment of such materials at the nanometer scale may be important for a \nvariety of biological applications. In this study, we have applied directional \nfreeze-drying, for the first time, to develop well aligned three dimensional \n(3D) nanofibrous materials using amino acid like L-phenylalanine (Phe). 3D \nfree-standing Phe nanofibrous monoliths have been successfully prepared using \ndirectional freeze-drying, and have presented a unique hierarchical structure \nwith well-aligned nanofibers at the nanometer scale and an ordered compartmental \narchitecture at the micrometer scale. We have found that the physical properties \n(e.g. nanofiber density and alignment) of the nanofibrous materials could be \ntuned by controlling the concentration and pH of the Phe solution and the \nfreezing temperature. Moreover, the same strategy (i.e. directional \nfreeze-drying) has been successfully applied to assemble peptide nanofibrous \nmaterials using a dipeptide (i.e. diphenylalanine), and to assemble Phe-based \nnanofibrous composites using polyethylenimine and poly(vinyl alcohol). The \ntunability of the nanofibrous structures together with the biocompatibility of \nPhe may make these 3D nanofibrous materials suitable for a variety of \napplications, including biosensor templates, tissue scaffolds, filtration \nmembranes, and absorbents. The strategy reported here is likely applicable to \ncreate aligned nanofibrous structures using other amino acids, peptides, and \npolymers.\n\nPhe, Phe-Phe, Rhodamine B (RhoB), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, Mw = 90,000), and \nbranched polyethylenimine (PEI, average Mw = \u223c25,000) were purchased from Sigma (St. \nLouis, MO). Distilled water was used as a solvent. RhoB labeled PEI (RhoB-PEI) was \nobtained by mixing PEI and RhoB in 50 mM phosphate buffered solution at a molar ratio of \n1:100 of PEI to RhoB, stirring for 2 h at room temperature, and dialyzing in deionized water \nusing a cellulose dialysis sack with a cutoff of 10 kDa for 2 days. Fresh stock solutions of \nPhe were prepared by dissolving Phe in distilled water at concentrations of 10, 25, 50, 100, \nand 150 mM. A Phe-Phe solution was prepared by dissolving Phe-Phe in distilled water with \nvigorous stirring at a concentration of 2 mM. Phe-PVA and Phe-PEI solutions were obtained \nby adding PVA or RhoB-PEI, respectively, into 100 mM Phe solution at a Phe/PVA or Phe/\nRhoB-PEI weight ratio of 5/1.\n1.5 mL of Phe, Phe-Phe, Phe-PEI, or Phe-PVA solution was pipetted into a 2 mL centrifuge \ntube. The tube was placed into liquid nitrogen or a \u221220 or \u221280 \u00b0C freezer. Frozen samples \nwere then freeze-dried using a Virtis automatic freeze-dryer.\nField emission scanning electron microscopy or FE-SEM (JEOL, JSM-7600F) was \nperformed at 10 kV to characterize the morphology of nanofibrous materials. Before \nimaging, samples were coated (Hummer IV Sputtering System) with a thin layer of gold to \npromote conductivity. The diameters of nanofibers were measured using an image analyzer \n(Adobe Photoshop CS2 9.0). A nanoscope multimode scanning probe microscope (Bruker \nInstruments) was used for the atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. RhoB stained \nsamples were examined under a confocal laser scanning microscopy or CLSM (LSM 510, \nCarl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded using a Jasco \nJ-810 spectropolarimeter (Japan) with instrument settings of 100 mdeg sensitivity, 1 nm \nbandwidth, 1 s response time, 1 nm data pitch, and 100 nm/min scan rate. A total of 50-80 \nscans were accumulated and averaged in each experiment. Materials were prepared at a \nconcentration of 100 \u03bcM and analyzed in a 10 mm quartz cell at 25\u00b0C. The CO 2 capture \nperformance of Phe nanofibrous monoliths was determined using thermal gravimetric \nanalysis (TGA) as we previously reported.37-39 In brief, samples were placed into the middle \nof the TGA microbalance quartz-tube reactor and heated to 105\u00b0C in a N2 atmosphere at a \nflow of 200 mL/min for about 60 min. The temperature was then adjusted to 40\u00b0C and pure \ndry CO2 was introduced at a gas flow rate of 200 mL/min until no obvious weight gain was \nobserved. The weight change in mg of the sorbents was recorded and the weight change in \npercentage was defined as the ratio of the amount of the gas adsorbed over the total amount \nof CO2 adsorbed. Adsorption capacity in mmol/(g sorbent) was calculated from the weight \nchange of the samples during adsorption."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"peptide_sequence\": \"FF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"fiber\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"100 H2O\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"0.625\", \"PH\": \"7.0\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"-20.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"nan\"}, {\"peptide_sequence\": \"FF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"fiber\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"100 H2O\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"0.625\", \"PH\": \"7.0\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"-80.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"nan\"}]"}]}

An equimolar quantity\nof NaOH (0.1 M, aq) was added, and the solution was gently\nstirred for 30 min until a clear solution was formed. The pH of this\nsolution was measured to be 10.7. To prepare hydrogels, solutions\nwere added to measured quantities of glucono-\u03b4-lactone (GdL)\naccording to the requirements of final pH, and the samples were\nleft to stand for 24 h.\npH Measurements and pKa Determination. A FC200 pH\nprobe (HANNA instruments) with a (6 mm (cid:2) 10 mm) conical tip\nwas employed for all the pH measurements. The stated accuracy\nof the pH measurements is (0.1. The pH changes during the\ngelation process were recorded every 1 min for 24 h. All measure-\nments were conducted at room temperature. The pKa values of\ndipeptide derivative (0.5 wt %) solutions were determined by\ntitration via the addition of aliquots of a 0.1 M HCl solution. pH\nvalues were also recorded every 2 s during the titration process. To\nprevent the formation of gel, the solutions were gently stirred, thus\nkeeping the solution liquid during the whole \u201ctitration\u201d process.\nCircular Dichroism and Linear Dichroism. Measurements\nwere performed at room temperature (21 (cid:1)C) on a Jasco J-815\nspectropolarimeter modified for linear dichroism (Jasco UK,\nGreat Dunmow, UK). Spectra were measured between 350 and\n180 nm with a data pitch of 0.2 nm. The bandwidth was set to 2 nm\nwith a scanning speed of 100 nm min-1 and a response time of 1 s.\nSpectra were collected at 2 min intervals. For clarity, the circular\ndichroism (CD) and linear dichroism (LD) figures show spectra\nonly every 10 min. The path length was 0.1 mm in a demountable\nSpectrosil quartz cuvette (Starna Optiglass, Hainault, UK). Note\nthat the sample was placed directly adjacent to the photomulti-\nplier tube in order to minimize loss of light due to scattering. All\nmeasurements were performed in duplicate.\nRheology. Initial tests for gelation were carried out by simple\nvial inversion.29 Typically, 2 mL of solution (with added GdL)\nwas placed in a sample tube (22 mm diameter, 60 mm high). After\nstanding for 24 h, the sample tube was inverted, with gelation\nbeing shown by a lack of flow. Dynamic rheological experiments\nwere performed on an Anton Paar Physica MCR101 rheometer.\nIn the oscillatory shear measurements, a sandblasted parallel top\nplate with a 50 mm diameter and 1.0 mm gap distance was used.\nGels for rheological experiments were prepared on the bottom\nplate of the rheometer by loading a 2.0 mL solution of the gelator\nimmediately after GdL addition. At this point, the sample is still a\nfree-flowing liquid. Hence, sample uniformity and reproducibility\nare high. Evaporation of water from the hydrogel was minimized\nby covering the sides of the plate with low-viscosity mineral oil.\nThe measurements of the shear modulus (storage modulus G0 and\nloss modulus G00) with gelation were made as a function of time at\na frequency of 1.59 Hz (10 rad/s) and at a constant strain of 0.5%\nfor a period of 2 h, followed by an amplitude sweep from 0.01% to\n100% under a frequency of 10 rad/s. The strain amplitude\nmeasurements were performed within the linear viscoelastic re-\ngion, where the storage modulus (G0) and loss modulus (G00) are\nindependent of the strain amplitude. All the experiments were\nconducted at 25 (cid:1)C.\nFluorescence Spectroscopy. Fluorescence spectra were ob-\ntained on a PerkinElmer luminescence spectrometer LS55. Thio-\nflavin T (ThT) (0.1 mL of a 0.5 \u03bcM solution in water) was added to\na solution of the dipeptide derivative (2 mL of a 0.5 wt % solution\nat pH 10.7). This was added to the required amount of GdL and\nimmediately loaded into a 1.0 cm path-length cuvette. Emission\nspectra were collected every 5 min in the first 3 h and then every\n30 min for 21 h. The emission spectra were recorded between 460\nand 600 nm by excitation at 455 nm. The maxima emission peaks\nwere at 485 nm.

Marchesan et al.\nA biocatalytic and thermoreversible hydrogel from a histidine-containing \ntripeptide \nShort peptides have emerged as very attractive minimalist\nbuilding blocks for supramolecular (bio)materials, in light of\ntheir simplicity of preparation and benign fate in biological\nsettings and in the environment.1 The vast majority of these\nsystems exploit synthetic N-capping groups that are rigid\nand aromatic (e.g., Fmoc, Nap, etc.), thus e\ufb00ectively templating\nself-assembly.2 Recently, useful tools have been developed to\npredict their gelation.3 In the case of unprotected (tri)peptides,\na priori self-assembly design in water is notoriously di\ufb03cult.\nDespite intense research e\ufb00orts have enabled the development\nof valid tools to predict their aggregation propensity,4\u20136 very few\nhydrogel examples have been reported thus far. The first\nunprotected tripeptides self-assembling into hydrogels were\ndescribed in 2012 and consisted of hydrophobic sequences\nthat exploited appropriate positioning of D- and L-amino acids\nin heterochiral sets of three.7,8 The key role played by the amino\nacid stereoconfiguration was confirmed in a complete stereo-\nisomer series whereby homochiral analogues did not assemble.9,10\nIn 2015, the first four L-tripeptides able to gel were reported,\nconsisting of amphiphilic sequences bearing a hydrophilic lysine\nand two aromatic amino acids (i.e, Phe, Tyr, and/or Trp).5 Another\nfour examples soon followed bearing amino acids Glu, Thr, Lys or\nCys besides aromatic Phe residues; however, they all required\nsmall amounts (i.e., 8%) of an organic solvent to assist the\ndissolution, and the final pH of the hydrogel was below 5, thus\nlimiting biological use.11 Considering that hydrogels formed by\nHere we report the first example of an unprotected tripeptide\nbearing His forming a supramolecular hydrogel under physio-\nlogical conditions. The hydrogel withstands temperatures used in\ncell culture for potential use as a biomaterial, is thermoreversible,\nand catalyses ester hydrolysis, thus showing potential towards\nfunctional soft materials.\nLHis\u2013DPhe\u2013DPhe formed a thermoreversible hydrogel at 2 wt%\nin phosphate buffer following a pH trigger to neutral at room\ntemperature (Fig. 1). The gel-to-sol transition had an onset\ntemperature of 45 1C, as observed visually and confirmed\nby differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). A homogeneous\nsolution was obtained at 65 1C and the gel reformed after ca.\n10 minutes upon cooling to room temperature (Fig. 1A). DSC\ndata confirmed a wide endotherm for the gel-to-sol transition,\nhowever, with a remarkably high Tm = 88\u201390 1C (see the ESI\u2020).\nThis temperature is compatible with that of the amyloid nano-\nstructure disassembly, as recently reviewed.12 While gel melting\nimplies the loss of the three-dimensional network forming the\ngel matrix, it does not necessarily correspond to a complete loss\nof the amyloid nanostructure, which typically occurs at higher\ntemperatures.\nThe viscoelastic properties of the system were assessed by\nrheometry that revealed good resistance to applied stress for\nthe peptide gel, since the gel-to-sol transition was observed at\n50 Pa (Fig. 1B). The elastic modulus was also considerably high\nfor an unprotected tripeptide, and reached 50 kPa and beyond\nas the self-assembly proceeded over time (Fig. 1C).\nFT-IR, Thioflavin T fluorescence assay, and CD were employed\nto assess the peptide conformation (Fig. 2 and the ESI\u2020). The\namide I band region in the FT-IR spectra is very informative of the\nsecondary structure, with beta-sheets most frequently reported for\nself-assembled short peptides.13,14 In the case of His\u2013Phe\u2013Phe\nhydrogels, the spectra displayed a signal compatible with the beta-\nsheets (1637 cm(cid:2)1) as typically occurs for similar amyloid\npeptides,10 although it was not possible to discern the presence\nof the characteristic shoulder for the anti-parallel arrangement,\ndue to the intense signal of the TFA counterion (1677 cm(cid:2)1).\nIn addition, the presence of other maxima at 1653 cm(cid:2)1 and\n1600 cm(cid:2)1 suggested a certain level of heterogeneity in the\npeptide secondary structure (Fig. 2A), which is compatible with\nthe wide gel-to-sol endotherm observed by DSC. The amide II\nband region was dominated by a broad signal centred at 1545 cm(cid:2)1\nand a shoulder at 1514 cm(cid:2)1. The amyloid structure based on\nbeta-sheets was also confirmed by the Thioflavin T fluorescence\nassay (see the ESI\u2020). The dye is known to bind laterally to\namyloid fibrils composed of at least four consecutive beta-\nstrands.15 This interaction limits the rotation of a single bond\nthat connects the two aromatic rings that compose the dye,\nresulting in fluorescence.16\nCD was also used to monitor the peptide conformation, as the\nregion of 190\u2013220 nm is indicative of the secondary structure.\nHowever, the concentration required for self-assembly led to signal\nsaturation below 220 nm even when 0.1 mm cuvettes were used.\nNevertheless, the acquisition of CD spectra in the 220\u2013300 nm\nregion over time proved to be useful to monitor the self-assembly\n(Fig. 2B). Ellipticity evolved during the first 20 minutes until it\nreached a plateau. A negative minimum at 225 nm suggested the\nD-supramolecular chirality as previously observed for heterochiral\nunprotected tripeptides.10 The spectrum was also characterised by\na shoulder at 230\u2013240 nm. In the near-UV region of 255\u2013270 nm,\nthe weak but distinctive signal of vibronic states for the forbidden\np - p* transition of the aromatic ring indicated that Phe side\nchains were located in a chiral environment.17\nAtomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron\nmicroscopy (TEM) were used to visualise nanomorphological\nfeatures of peptide assemblies (Fig. 3). The hydrogel was formed\nby a dense network of bundles of fibres reaching a thickness of\nover 1 micron, and as long as tens of microns, thus explaining\nthe high elastic modulus registered by rheometry.\nNext, the catalytic function of the hydrogel was assessed.\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the\ndevelopment of minimalist peptide motifs for biocatalysis.\nIn particular, esterase-mimicking motifs have been the most\nstudied ones, and typically employ sequences containing either\nthe Ser\u2013His\u2013Asp catalytic triad or the His\u2013Zn2+ coordination\nmotif. While His alone does not exhibit catalytic activity, it is\nthe most important amino acid playing the role of a proton\ndonor or acceptor in ester hydrolysis.18 The supramolecular\norganisation of His-bearing peptides is a strategy that can\nsuccessfully achieve biocatalysis through the creation of multi-\nvalency, typically featuring ordered arrays of His residues. While\ninitial reports displayed peptides as long as 42 amino acids,19,20\nresearch efforts have ever since been devoted towards the develop-\nment of conveniently shorter sequences. To date, this approach has\nbeen proven to be successful for nanofibers formed by decapeptide\namphiphiles,21 capped 14-mer22 and 7-mer23,24 peptides, and\neven N-acetylated pentamers assembled on the surface of gold\nnanoparticles.25 This minimalist approach culminated with\nFmoc\u2013tripeptide nanotubes.26 However, all these examples\nfeature peptides derivatised at either one or both termini, likely\ndue to the intrinsic difficulties of the self-assembly design\nfor unprotected short peptides. Besides, it should be noted\nthat catalysis by means of isolated nanostructures in solution\nis markedly different from the catalysis occurring in bulk\nfunctional materials.\nFig. 3 (A) AFM image of peptide hydrogel. (B) TEM image at high (left) and\nlow (right) magnifications of the peptide hydrogel.\nthe yellow-coloured p-nitrophenol (pNP) that is easily quanti-\nfied by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm.27 The product\nformation was monitored over one hour (Fig. 4 and the ESI\u2020), and\nit was negligible for control samples with 1 mM peptide solution\nor bu\ufb00er (kobs = 5.0 (cid:3) 10(cid:2)5 s(cid:2)1 in both cases). By contrast, the\npresence of the supramolecular hydrogel resulted in marked\nbiocatalysis (kobs = 9.5 (cid:3) 10(cid:2)4 s(cid:2)1 increased to 1.7 (cid:3) 10(cid:2)3 s(cid:2)1\nwith 1 mM pNPA), and that reached a plateau corresponding to\ncomplete conversion of the substrate into the product, and visibly\nyellow gels. Intermediate peptide concentrations that were\nbelow mgc displayed moderate catalysis (Fig. 4C) and absence\nof a linear dependence of kobs on the peptide concentration.\nTEM analysis (see the ESI\u2020) revealed the presence of thin\nnanofibrils (10 mM sample) and also oligomers and protofibrils\n(25 mM sample), which are typical morphologies of early-stage\namyloid assemblies.28,29 Overall, these results confirmed that\nthe esterase-like activity is associated with the formation of\nsupramolecular structures.\nIn conclusion, we reported herein the first unprotected\ntripeptide bearing His and forming supramolecular hydrogels\nunder physiological conditions. In the context of unprotected\ntripeptide hydrogels, this is the first example displaying a catalytic\nfunction, thus setting a new benchmark in the quest for minimalist\nbiocatalysts.

This assembly and organisation arises\nfrom cooperative\nmolecules including hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions\nand, of relevance here, p-stacking. When the \ufb01bre-forming\nmolecules include a suitable donor chromophore, these \ufb01bres\ncan be used to transfer energy to a second acceptor\nchromophore within the system. A number of reports detail\nthe use of this approach in organic solvents.4 However, the use\nof hydrogelators containing \ufb01bril-forming donor chromophores\nand a suitable hosted acceptor is less common. Light-harvesting\nhydrogels have been prepared from cationic glutamate derivatives\nthat complex with a mixture of anionic naphthalene- and\nanthracene-based \ufb02uorophores.5 Energy transfer between a\nnaphthalene-based hydrogelator and a dansyl probe has also\nbeen demonstrated, but required the initial dissolution of the\ngelator in DMSO.6 Very recently, MacPhee et al. reported\nenergy transfer between donor and acceptor chromophores\nconjugated to \ufb01bre-forming peptides.7 Again, an organic\nsolvent was utilised for initial dissolution of the peptides.\nHere, we show that multicomponent hydrogels can be\nprepared that undergo energy transfer by incorporation of a\nsuitable acceptor moiety or by mixing dipeptide-conjugates.\nThis second system requires no organic solvent\nassembly.\nfunctionalised at\nthe N-terminus have been shown to be e\ufb00ective hydrogelators.\nTo enable gelation, a common strategy is conjugation at\nthe N-terminus with an aromatic group such as \ufb02uorenyl-\nmethoxycarbonyl\nIn addition\nto being integral to gelation, these aromatic groups are\nalso convenient \ufb02uorophores with which to probe energy\ntransfer. Hydrogelation is often carried out in these systems\nvia a pH switch; the dipeptide-conjugates are soluble at high\npH and gel at a lower pH. We have recently reported the use of\nthe hydrolysis of glucono-d-lactone (GdL) to controllably\nreduce the pH in such systems which allows the formation of\nhighly reproducible hydrogels.10 This method also allows the\ngelation to be monitored with time since the hydrolysis of GdL\ntakes a number of hours to come to completion. Using this\nmethod, we have shown that a naphthalene-dipeptide assembles\ninto \ufb01bres via b-sheet formation between the dipeptide segment\nwith the concomitant arrangement of the naphthalene groups\ninto a left-handed helical stack.11 We showed that addition\nof thio\ufb02avin T results in incorporation of the dye within\nthe b-sheets of the self-assembled \ufb01bres, resulting in an\nincrease in \ufb02uorescence on formation of b-sheets between\nthe dipeptides.11 We rationalised that incorporation of an\nacceptor chromophore within the aromatic stacks should lead\nto e\ufb03cient energy transfer.\nNaphthalene-diphenylalanine was prepared using standard\nsynthetic protocols from 2-naphthol (see ESIw for details).\nA 2.2 mM aqueous solution of naphthalene-diphenylalanine,\nI (Fig. 1a), was prepared via the addition of NaOH to an\naqueous suspension of the dipeptide (the sodium salt of I is\ncompletely soluble). Addition of 3.75 mg mL(cid:2)1 of GdL\nresulted in the formation of a transparent, self-supporting\nhydrogel after approximately 15 min (demonstrated by stability\nto vial inversion, Fig. 1b) with the pH dropping to 3.3 over\n800 min (see Fig. S1, ESIw). Following the gelation process by\n\ufb02uorescence, a slight red-shift was observed with time on\nexcitation of the system at 280 nm as has been reported\nelsewhere for related naphthol-dipeptide systems,9 Fig. 2a.\nIn addition, an increase in intensity was observed compared\nto the solution at high pH. This increase in intensity is\npresumably due to the di\ufb00erence in environment at high and\nlow pH (micellar structures form \ufb01brous structures as the pH\ndrops, see Fig. S10, ESIw). A shoulder at 370 nm became more\npronounced on gelation, Fig. 2a. No further change was seen\nafter 120 min. Emission at 355 nm is suitable for energy\ntransfer to chromophores with a excitation maximum at this\nwavelength. These include anthracene and certain dansyl\nderivatives. Addition of a dansyl derivative (II, Fig. 1a) to a\nconcentration of 0.085 mM using a stock solution in methanol\n(4.0 mol% relative to I) had no discernable e\ufb00ect on the\nhydrogelation. The change in pH was very similar to the\ndipeptide solution alone on addition to GdL (Fig. S1, ESIw).\nThe rheological data for hydrogels prepared with and without\nII were also very similar (Fig. S2, ESIw). After 100 min, there is\nno change in the rheological data, implying that structure\nevolution is complete by this point, despite the fact that the pH\nPublished on 11 May 2010.

Such behaviour has been\ndemonstrated previously for such systems.10,11 We probed\nthe e\ufb00ect of adding II by \ufb02uorescence. On excitation of the\nnaphthalene rings at 280 nm at high pH (before gelation), a\nsimilar emission at 355 nm was observed along with a weak\nemission at 540 nm (arising from the dansyl derivative in a\nhydrophilic environment). The intensity of emission at 355 nm\nwas lower than in the absence of II, indicating that energy\ntransfer occurs to some degree even at high pH. On addition of\nGdL, the intensity of the emission at 355 nm increased again\nwith time (and decreasing pH due to the slow hydrolysis of\nGdL), Fig. 2b, but not to the same degree as in the absence\nof II. The emission at 540 nm decreased, being replaced with\nan increase in emission at 485 nm. This can be attributed to II\nenvironment6\nand therefore is strongly indicative of II being incorporated\nwithin the self-assembled \ufb01bres. This incorporation into the\nself-assembled aggregates and resulting energy transfer can be\nmonitored with time, Fig. 2b. The ratio of emission at 355 nm\nto 485 nm varied as expected with the concentration of II\nadded, Fig. 2c (see also Fig. S8, ESIw).\nthe acceptor molecules are simply\nincorporated in the system via addition of a stock solution\nand presumably interact via the hydrophobicity of the \ufb01bres.\nIn addition to these systems, where a suitable chromophore is\nadded to a dipeptide-conjugate, we have also found that\nsimilar results could be obtained using a system where both\nFig. 2 (a) Fluorescence spectra for a solution of I (2.2 mM) before\nand after GdL addition.

III alone does not form a stable hydrogel on\npH decrease; instead precipitation occurs (data not shown).\nHowever, addition of 10 mL of a solution of (III) (12.1 mM) to\na solution of I (2.2 mM) at pH 10 resulted in a clear solution\nas for I alone. No organic solvents were required for this.\nOn addition of GdL, a self-supporting hydrogel formed that\nwas again optically transparent, Fig. 3b. We again followed\nthe gelation with \ufb02uorescence. A complex emission spectrum\nbetween 390 and 500 nm appeared, replacing the emission\nFig. 1 (a) Structure of naphthalene-diphenylalanine (I) and dansyl\nderivative (II).

Similarly, a number of di\ufb00erent aromatic\nmoieties have been shown to be suitable for the preparation of\ndipeptide hydrogels. Hence, future work will concentrate on\ntuning the emission to allow energy transfer between a wider\nrange of molecules. This strategy could be useful for the design\nof the next generation of light harvesting materials.\n6 M. Montalti, L. S. Dolci, L. Prodi, N. Zaccheroni, M. C. A. Stuart,\nK. J. C. van Bommel and A.

Again, the\nratio of emission at 355 nm to that at 440 nm varied with\nconcentration of added III (see Fig. S8, ESIw). Mixing gelators\nhas been used recently for cell culturing applications;12\nthe successful energy transfer demonstrated here shows that\nco-assembly into \ufb01bres is occurring in the current system as\nopposed to phase separation into \ufb01bres of one gelator and\n\ufb01bres of the other (where e\ufb00ective energy transfer would not\nbe expected). This method may therefore be useful not just\nfor energy transfer applications, but also for probing the\nco-assembly of gelators.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that energy transfer is\npossible from a naphthalene-dipeptide to dansyl or anthracene\nchromophores as a hydrogel is formed. The formation of the\nhydrogel is accompanied by an increase in p-stacking between\nchromophores as long \ufb01brous structures are formed. This is a\nhighly robust system, with the use of GdL to alter the pH\nallowing the kinetics of assembly to be probed in addition to\nthe initial and \ufb01nal states. The simplicity of the gelator systems\nmakes this an attractive method for generating optically\ntransparent hydrogels capable of energy transfer.

Because the gel diameter\nmatched that of the top plate, gels were not trimmed prior to analysis.\nThe strain amplitude used in the tests was 1%, and the angular\nfrequency was varied from 0.2 to 5 rad/s over eight points. For each\ngel, the storage and loss moduli were calculated as the average of the\neight points.\nMolecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations. MD simulations were\nperformed on Fmoc-AA and Fmoc-ALac \ufb01brils. The simulated \ufb01bril\nstructures were based on previous results derived for the Fmoc-AA\n\ufb01bril (100 molecules that had already undergone a 160 ns simulation\nand here proven to be stable).8 MD simulations were performed using\nGROMACS (version 4.5.4). The atomic force \ufb01eld parameters were\ntransformed from OPLS-AA,10 OPLS-AA/L,11 MM3,12 and our\nprevious work.8 Molecular dynamics simulations were performed on\nthe Texas Advanced Computing Center\u2019s \u201cLonestar\u201d supercomputer.\nAll simulations were applied periodic boxes with explicit TIP3P water\nmolecules, and all were subjected to steepest-descent energy\nminimizations with 5000 maximum steps to remove high-energy\ncontacts. In order to keep the system stable at 300 K and 1 bar, 100 ps\nNVT and 100 ps NPT equilibrations were applied, respectively. The\nLINCS algorithm was applied to constrain bonds.13 Further details can\nbe found in our previous paper.8 Modeling parameters were derived\nfrom previous studies,8,14 and \ufb01nal simulated \ufb01bril structures in .pdb\nformat are provided in the Supporting Information.\nMelting-Temperature Simulations. For DNA and similar\nmaterials stabilized largely by noncovalent intermolecular interactions,\nthe measurement of a melting temperature can be used to quantify the\nmaterial\u2019s stability and predict sequence-dependent thermodynamic\nbehavior.15\u221217 In this work, we simulated a similar melting procedure\nand obtained the melting curves to understand the e\ufb00ect of replacing\nthe amide bond of Fmoc-AA with an ester bond. When the\ntemperature is gradually increased to some point (the so-called\nmelting temperature in this article),\nthe noncovalent interactions\nbetween individual molecules within a \ufb01bril structure will be disrupted;\ntherefore, the \ufb01bril structure breaks apart and the fraction of the\nmolecular surface area exposed to solvent will increase. By measuring\nthe solvent -accessible surface area (SASA) with increasing temper-\nature from 670 to 870 K, we quantitatively estimated the e\ufb00ect of\nchanging the terminal\nresidue (Ala to Lac) on noncovalent\nintermolecular interactions between Fmoc-dipeptides within a self-\nassembled \ufb01bril structure. During the simulations, for each selected\ntemperature window at least one 50 ns MD simulation was performed\nand the last 30 ns SASA results were averaged to plot. The standard\ndeviation for each point has been indicated as error bars in Figure 5A.\nPotential of Mean Force.

Ac-L-Phe-L-\nPhe-L-Ala-NH2 self-assembles at physiological pH without the\nneed for any organic solvent. This tripeptide derivative con-\ntains an aromatic diphenylalanine moiety (Phe\u2013Phe) as a mini-\nmalistic building block to drive the self-assembly of short\npeptides into nanostructures and hydrogels of high stability.9\nThe tripeptide hydrogelator Ac-L-Phe-L-Phe-L-Ala-NH2 was\nprepared in five synthetic steps (Scheme S-1\u2020).

The self-assembly was triggered by mixing cell\nsuspensions in media with a physiological saline solution of\nthe peptide molecules and the cells survived the growth of the\nnanofibers around them.

The storage modulus (G\u2032) is 6 fold\ngreater than the loss modulus (G\u2033) under constant strain at 2%\n(Fig. S-12\u2020) which indicates the viscoelastic properties of the\nproposed hydrogel biomaterial.

The\nnovel supramolecular hydrogel was shown to be e\ufb00ective in\nenhancing cell proliferation up to 5 days of culturing. In\naddition, the obtained results reveal the advantages of the\nnovel tripeptide hydrogel compared to Matrigel. A small pro-\nportion of the cells precipitated during this time at the bottom\nof the wells in both Ac-L-Phe-L-Phe-L-Ala-NH2 hydrogel and\nMatrigel, but the majority of the cells remained in gels and\nformed agglomerates.

More relevant studies are \ndesired to better mimic 3D in vivo tissue growth. Such realistic environments \nshould be the aim of any cell growth study, requiring new methods for culturing \ncells in vitro. Cell biology is also tending toward miniaturization for \nincreased efficiency and specificity. This paper discusses the application of a \nself-assembling peptide-derived hydrogel for use as a 3D cell culture scaffold \nat the microscale.\nRESULTS: Phenylalanine derivative hydrogel formation was seen to occur in \nmultiple dispersion media. Cells were immobilized in situ within microchambers \ndesigned for cell analysis. Use of the highly biocompatible hydrogel components \nand simplistic procedures significantly reduced the cytotoxic effects seen with \nalternate 3D culture materials and microstructure loading methods. Cells were \neasily immobilized, sustained and removed from microchambers. Differences in \ngrowth morphology were seen in the cultured cells, owing to the 3-dimentional \ncharacter of the gel structure. Degradation improved the removal of hydrogel \nfrom the microstructures, permitting reuse of the analysis platforms.\nCONCLUSION: Self-assembling diphenylalanine derivative hydrogel provided a \nmethod to dramatically reduce the typical difficulties of microculture \nformation. Effective generation of patterned 3D cultures will lead to improved \ncell study results by better modeling in vivo growth environments and increasing \nefficiency and specificity of cell studies. Use of simplified growth scaffolds \nsuch as peptide-derived hydrogel should be seen as highly advantageous and will \nlikely become more commonplace in cell culture methodology.\n\nGel Formation\nThe self-assembling hydrogel samples were made by first\ncreating  a  gelling  agent.  Lyophilized  Fmoc-Phe-Phe\ndipeptide (Bachem) was weighed and dissolved in dime-\nthyl  sulfoxide  (DMSO).  Deviating  from  the  preliminary\nmethods provided by Mahler et al., DMSO was selected to\nreplace  1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol  because  it  is\nless  detrimental  to  cell  viability.  The  gelling  agent  was\nused  in  concentrations  of  25  and  100  mg/ml.  A  small\nstock solution was created to run experiments for each day\nso  as  to  avoid  any  pre-aggregation  of  dipeptide  deriva-\ntives. The gelling agent was applied to the desired disper-\nsion medium by pipette addition to a final concentration\nof either 5 or 10 mg/ml; the higher concentration corre-\nsponded to increased gel stability. The gel was created in\nsitu  within  the  desired  analysis  structure.  All  structures\nwere fabricated via silicon etching/masking procedures by\nthe  Microsystems  Technology  Group  in  the  School  of\nElectrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology, Swe-\nden.  Transparent  glass  cover  slides  were  bonded  to  the\netched surface to create channels and chambers for micro-\nscopic observation.\nLayer  formation  was  performed  by  repetition  of  the  gel\nforming procedure. The initial layer was first generated in\na  generic  mold  and  allowed  to  stabilize.  Upon  stabile\nhydrogel formation, the additional dispersion media was\nadded to the mold, forming a fluid layer above the stable\nhydrogel.  An  appropriate  amount  of  gelling  agent  was\ndirectly added to the fluid layer. Layers were only formed\nin purified water, but it can be assumed that all successful\ndispersion media can also be used in layer formation. We\nonly examined the use of 25 mg/ml gelling agents for a\nfinal  hydrogel  concentration  of  10  mg/ml.  Diffusion  of\ndispersion  medium  in  layers  was  observed  by  adding  a\ncolored dye in one layer of hydrogel. For general diffusion\nobservation, a drop of dye was applied to a stable get and\nallowed to diffuse into the sample.\nGel Reversing\nMechanical  reversing  was  performed  by  applying  sheer\nforces to a stable gel. Large samples were destabilized by\nvortex or pipette mixing. Environmental pH changes were\nalso used to reverse assembled gel stability. NaOH (0.5M)\nwas  added  to  elevate  the  matrix  solution  above  pH  9.\nEnzyme  reversing  was  performed  with  proteinase  K\n(Sigma-Aldrich).  Reversing  in  microstructures  was  per-\nformed by actively applying a flow of reversing solution:\n0.05 mg/ml proteinase K, 1.0 wt% SDS, pH between 9 and\n10,  and  temperature  control  at  37\u00b0C.  Microchambers\nwere all flanked by parallel channels (Figure 4) where the\nenzyme reversing solution was perfused. Precision pumps\nwere fitted to drive the solution from a syringe, through\nflexible tubing, into the inlets of the parallel microchan-\nnels, and out through the outlets. The microchip stage and\nperfusion tubing setup is shown in Figure 10.\nDetecting Gel Transitions\nTo confirm gel formation, two protocols were employed.\nThe first was a macroscopic observation of the gel stabil-\nity. In the presence of a rigid conformation, the hydrogel\nshould be sufficiently stable to undergo and inversion test\nwithout  conformational  changes.  Inversion  testing  was\nperformed on 2 ml samples in a 15 ml Falcon Tube. After\nappropriate  stabilization  time,  the  sample  was  inverted\nand  monitored  for  deformation.  A  sample  undergoing\nincomplete gel transition shows deformation in the form\nof flow toward the lid (lowest point of the inverted tube).\nA complete and stable hydrogel transition was character-\nized by an inversion test resulting in zero visible deforma-\ntion.  A  successful \ninversion  test  confirmed  stable\nmacroscopic hydrogel formation.\nThe second protocol utilized to verify gel stability required\nobservation  at  the  microscopic  level.  Optically  distin-\nguishable foreign material was added to the gel and mon-\nitored  by  confocal  microscopy.  The  'impurity'  behavior\nwas  then  used  to  infer  hydrogel  characteristics.  Fluores-\ncent  microspheres  (15  \u03bcm  Focal  Check  microspheres,\nMolecular  Probes)  were  suspended  in  the  dispersion\nmedium  of  choice  just  prior  to  addition  of  the  gelling\nagent. The microspheres were then induced with 488 nm\nlaser excitation on a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal confocal micro-\nscope over a 10 minute detection time interval. Confocal\ntracking of the microspheres presented the level of stabil-\nity of the hydrogel matrix in the form of sphere immobil-\nity. Immobilization of the suspended microspheres over\nan extended time period was a sufficient indication of a\nstable hydrogel matrix.\nStable hydrogel samples were monitored for sensitivity to\nmultiple  reversing  methods.  The  above  gel  transition\nmethods were utilized to demonstrate reverse transitions\nfrom stable a stable hydrogel matrix to a less stable liquid\nsolution. If a stable hydrogel sample can be modified such\nthat it no longer satisfies the discussed requirements for a\nstable gel, the sample has reverted from a gel to a liquid\nphase  solution.  More  explicitly,  a  sample  that  fails  the\ninversion test or shows a dramatic increase in microscopic\nmovement upon modification is no longer considered a\nstable hydrogel.\nCell Inclusion\nThe cell lines examined in hydrogel cultures include COS-\n7, MDCK, and two strains of Astrocytes (CTX TNA2 and\nDI TNC1), all obtained from ECACC. Each cell line was\ncultured  according  to  the  ECACC  recommendations.\nAstrocytes were grown to confluency in a liquid culture of\nMEM (Gibco) and the remaining cell lines were grown in\nDMEM  (Sigma).  Cells  were  grown  with  an  addition  of\n10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 1.0% penicillin/strepto-\nmycin  (Sigma)  and  1.0%  L-glutamine  (Sigma).  MDCK\ncells  were  grown  with  an  additional  treatment  of  1.0%\nnon-essential  amino  acids  (Sigma).  Incubation  was  per-\nformed at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 and 100% humidity. The\ncells  were  harvested  from  the  culturing  petri  dishes  by\ntrypsinization.  The  harvested  cells  were spun  down  to a\npellet by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 1700 rpm. Cells\nwere then washed twice before a final spin down. Staining\ntreatments and washing were performed with a standard\nphosphate  buffered  saline  solution  (1\u00d7  PBS).  The  final\ncell pellet was then immobilized in the peptide derivative\nextracellular matrix by first suspending in PBS and adding\nthe gelling agent to initiate hydrogel self-assembly. A typ-\nical cell number density used was between 5 and 12 mil-\nlion cells/ml of final gel volume. Nutrients were supplied\nto the immobilized cell suspensions by perfusion as soon\nas  the  hydrogel  was  stabilized.  For  long-term  culturing,\nthe  microstructures  were  removed  from  the  microchip\nplatform  and  submerged  in  culture  media  under  37\u00b0C.\nCells  were  viewed  by  staining  with  1.0  \u03bcM  calcein-AM\n(Invitrogen). If the cells were to be stained before in situ\nculture  formation,  calcein-AM  was  added  to  the  disper-\nsion medium. For in situ staining within the microcham-\nber,  calcein-AM  was  added  to  a  perfusion  solution  of\ngrowth medium and perfused through the microchannels.\nCells were maintained in stain solution for 30 minutes to\n1 hour at 37\u00b0C before confocal observation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"peptide_sequence\": \"FF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"none\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Fmoc\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"5/95 DMSO/PBS\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"5.025\", \"PH\": \"7.0\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"37.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"nan\"}, {\"peptide_sequence\": \"FF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"none\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Fmoc\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"10/90 DMSO/PBS\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"10.05\", \"PH\": \"7.0\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"37.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"nan\"}, {\"peptide_sequence\": \"FF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"none\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Fmoc\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"20/80 DMSO/PBS\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"5.025\", \"PH\": \"7.0\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"37.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"nan\"}, {\"peptide_sequence\": \"FF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"hydrogel\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Fmoc\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"40/60 DMSO/PBS\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"10.05\", \"PH\": \"7.0\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"37.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"nan\"}]"}]}

However, their use in bone tissue \nengineering is limited due to their low mechanical properties. In this study, we \ndesigned and synthesized multicomponent peptide-based hydrogels composed of \nfluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl diphenylalanine (FmocFF), which contributed to the \nrigidity and stability of the hydrogel, and Fmoc-arginine (FmocR), which \nmediated high affinity to hydroxyapatite (HAP) due to the arginine moiety. The \nnew hydrogels composed of nanometric fibril networks were decorated with HAP and \ndemonstrated high mechanical strength with a storage modulus of up to 29 kPa. In \naddition, the hydrogels supported cell adhesion and in vitro cell viability. \nThese properties suggest using these multicomponent organic-inorganic hydrogels \nas functional biomaterials for improved bone regeneration.\n\ncommonly implemented for bone regeneration due to their low\nmechanical properties compared to those of the natural bone.26\nConsequently, the use of synthetic biomaterial hydrogels with\ncontrollable and reproducible properties is appealing for bone\ntissue engineering.27\nShort peptides can be used as low molecular weight gelators\nand form mechanically stable hydrogels through self-assembly\ninto supramolecular structures,28\u221234 which typically arise from\nnoncovalent interactions such as hydrogen-bonding, van der\nWaals interactions, \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking, and electrostatic interac-\ntions.35\u221237 Furthermore, the material properties can be tailored\nto form multicomponent supramolecular gels composed of (1)\ntwo components that do not form a gel on their own, (2) two\nor more gelators that can either coassemble or self-sort into\ndistinct assemblies, or (3) one or more gelators and one or\nmore nongelling additives that can a\ufb00ect the assembly process\nof the gelator.38\u221241 Controlling the properties of the resulting\ngels is achieved by di\ufb00erent interactions and by changing the\nratio of the di\ufb00erent components, enabling modulation of\ncellular functionality and tissue morphogenesis.39,42\nFluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-functionalized pepti-\ndes are of the most studied low molecular weight gelators.

Rheological measurements were performed\nusing an AR-G2 controlled-stress rheometer (TA Instruments, USA).\nTime-sweep oscillatory tests in parallel plate geometry were performed\non 250 \u03bcL of fresh solution (resulting in a gap size of 0.6 mm) at room\ntemperature. Oscillatory strain (0.01\u2212100%) and frequency sweeps\n(0.01\u2212100 Hz) were conducted to determine the linear viscoelastic\nregion at which the time sweep oscillatory tests were performed.

Unlike traditional heat treatment or solvent\nmodulation, cryogenic treatment at 77 K enabled the tunable\ntransition of a self-assembled diphenylalanine organogel into\na hexagonal crystal. Under these conditions, the assembled\nmolecules undergo an internal rearrangement in the solid state\nto form a well-defined chiral crystal structure. Moreover, these\nassemblies exhibit enhanced emission. This strategy for the\nsynthesis of single-component supramolecular assemblies can\ncreate new functions by manipulating phase transitions.\nas a breakthrough strategy in nanoscience and nanotechnol-\nogy.[1\u20133] As it enables the formation of self-assemblies with\ndesired properties, this bottom-up approach has already\nfound various applications in biomedicine, electrical engi-\nneering, and materials science.[4\u20137] Peptides contain all of the\nmolecular information that is needed to rapidly and effi-\nciently form ordered assemblies with various structures,\nranging from nanotubes to fiber bundles, and a series of\nconformations, such as a-helices and b-sheets.[8\u201310] In partic-\nular, short peptides can assemble into diverse aggregate\nstructures, such as spheres, micelles, vesicles, tubes, rods, and\nfibers. Among these peptides, diphenylalanine (FF), the\nsimplest aromatic dipeptide, has attracted significant interest\nbecause of its favorable features,\nincluding its structural\nsimplicity, biocompatibility, facile chemical modification, and\nthe fact that its self-assembly can be tuned particularly\nwell.[11\u201315] In our previous work, we constructed various FF-\nbased microstructures, such as organogels, microcrystals, and\nhierarchical mesocrystals, in a controlled manner.[16\u201319]\nLow-molecular-weight gelators (LMWGs) with three-\ndimensional open nanostructures have attracted substantial\nattention.[20, 21] A wide range of peptides, including FF, exhibit\ngood LMWG behavior through various intermolecular non-\ncovalent interactions, such as p\u2013p stacking, hydrogen bond-\ning, electrostatic, and van der Waals interactions.[22, 23] Gen-\nerally, gels are unstable systems because of the balance\nbetween the molecular aggregation force and solubilizing\ngelator\u2013solvent interactions.[24, 25] Notably, physical gelation is\na spontaneous, thermodynamically and kinetically driven\nprocess.[26] Owing to the weakness of\nthe non-covalent\ninteractions exploited to maintain the aforementioned equi-\nlibrium, such metastable physical gels can be converted into\nthermodynamically stable crystals. The gel\u2013crystal transitions\nin several systems have been observed to be triggered by\nvarious stimuli, such as light irradiation, pH changes, heating/\ncooling, a change in ionic strength or solvent, or even\nstorage.[27\u201335] For instance, our group has demonstrated that\nthe structural transition from an organogel to flower-like\nmicrocrystals can be induced in the dipeptide self-assembly\nsystem by using ethanol as a co-solvent.[18]\nHerein, we explore cryogenic treatment as an approach to\nachieve a tunable transition from a dipeptide-based self-\nassembled organogel to a well-ordered crystal (Scheme 1).\nSpecifically, cryogenic treatment of a FF\u2013toluene gel resulted\nin a gel\u2013crystal transition. The transition process was moni-\ntored for several cycles as the temperature of the system was\nchanged from 77 K to room temperature. Interestingly, the\naforementioned transition enables the fabrication of a bio-\nmolecule-based nanosystem with enhanced emission. Fur-\nthermore, this novel and general approach can be used to\nfacilitate transitions of other FF-based gel systems.\nScheme 1. The transition of a dipeptide-based organogel into a hexago-\nnal crystal with enhanced emission under extremely cold conditions\n(liquid nitrogen, 77 K).\nTo gain further insight into how a cryogenic treatment\naffects self-assembled organogels, we used scanning electron\nmicroscopy (SEM) to analyze their morphology. As we\nreported previously,[17] a transparent gel was rapidly obtained\nwhen a FF/1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) solution\nwas diluted with toluene. The resulting organogel consisted of\nultrafine fibers (Figure 1 a). Cryogenic treatment for different\nperiods of time resulted in the appearance of the gels\nchanging from transparent to opaque. Specifically, after two\ntreatments, some small fibers appeared, even though the gel\nremained transparent (Figure 1 b). When the number of\ntreatments was increased to five, the morphology clearly\nchanged to short bundled fibers (Figure 1 c). Meanwhile, the\norganogels gradually became opaque after five or more\ntreatments. As depicted in Figure 1 d, after ten cycles, longer\nfibers with few bundles were produced. When the cycle\nnumber was increased to sixteen, the fiber morphology\nbecame homogeneous and dispersive, and the fibers had\nlengths of several dozens of micrometers and widths of\napproximately 200 nm (Figure 1 e). When the number of\ntreatments was further increased to as many as 30 cycles, no\nobvious morphology changes were observed (see the Sup-\nporting Information, Figure S1). The transmission electron\nmicroscopy (TEM) image in Figure 1 f also shows that the\nfibers were 200 nm wide, which is in good agreement with the\nSEM results.\nFigure 1. SEM images of FF\u2013toluene organogels after different num-\nbers of cryogenic treatments: a) 0, b) 2, c) 5, d) 10, and e) 16 treat-\nments. The insets show the corresponding photographs. f) TEM image\nof an organogel after 16 cryogenic treatment cycles.\nThe images in Figure 2 a, which were obtained using\na cross-polarized microscope, show that the assembly was not\nparticularly bright before the treatment. By contrast, after the\ntreatment, bright fibers were observed (Figure 2 b), which\nsuggests the presence of fibril bundles, resulting in vibrational\nbrightness. Specifically, when the macroscopic fibers were\naligned at an angle of 4588 relative to the polarizer, the\nanisotropic birefringence was minimized. The birefringence\nof these fibers became very strong again when they were\naligned at an angle of 9088 with respect to the polarizer. These\nresults reveal that the crystalline fibers were aligned after the\ncryogenic treatment.\nThe viscoelastic properties of the gels were measured by\noscillatory rheology experiments. Generally, the viscoelastic\nbehavior of a gel is determined by two key parameters, the\nstorage modulus (G\u2019) and the loss modulus (G\u2019\u2019), which\nrepresent the ability of a gel to return to its original geometry\nand the tendency of a material to flow under applied stress.[34]\nFor a gel, G\u2019 is greater than G\u2019\u2019, and G\u2019 is very weakly\ndependent on the oscillatory frequency, demonstrating the\ndominant elastic behavior of the gel. The results shown in\nFigure 3 a confirm the formation of an organogel and its\nelastic properties. Importantly, as the cryogenic treatment was\nrepeated for\nthe mechanical\nstrength increased. The higher mechanical strength may\nfrom enhanced molecular interactions in the FF\nassembly.\nTo investigate the molecular interactions during the\ntransition process,\nthe system was analyzed by Fourier\ntransform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Figure 3 b shows\nthe characteristic peaks of an amide I band at 1681 cm@1 and\nan amide II absorption band at approximately 1608 cm@1,\ncorresponding to a hydrogen-bonded b-sheet secondary\nstructure with antiparallel alignment.[16, 36] When the number\nof cryogenic treatments was increased further, the peak at\n1608 cm@1 was red-shifted to approximately 1604 cm@1 and\nthe peak at 1681 cm@1 was\nshifted to approximately\n1686 cm@1. These shifts may be due to the effect of the\ncryogenic treatment on the hydrogen bonding between C=O\nand N@H moieties in the FF assembly.[16]\nature, toluene returns to the liquid state much earlier than\nHFIP, and the FF\u2013toluene interactions lead to gel aggregation\nby stochastic nucleation,[39] that is, the evolution could be\na result of the rebalance of molecular interactions such as p\u2013p\nstacking, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interactions.[40]\nThus the cryogenic treatment mediates the rebalancing effect,\nenabling the transformation of a metastable gel phase into\na thermodynamically stable crystal phase.[34]\nInterestingly, during the transition process, the well-\nordered FF crystals exhibited enhanced emission properties.\nSpecifically, as shown in Figure 4 a, upon excitation at l =\n250 nm, the photoluminescence emission peak of the FF/\nHFIP solution at l = 285 nm shifted to 295 nm in FF\u2013toluene\ngel as the molecules aggregated into gels. As the number of\ncryogenic treatments was increased, the emission intensity\nincreased gradually but significantly (Figure 4 b). This behav-\nior may be due to the decreased vibrational relaxation in the\ncrystal state.\nFigure 4. Photoluminescence emission spectra of a) a solution of FF\nin HFIP and a FF\u2013toluene gel and b) FF\u2013toluene gels after different\nnumbers of cryogenic treatments.\nThis strategy based on cryogenic treatments can be\nextended to achieve the transition of other FF-based gels\ninto a crystalline state. Figure S3 shows that similar phenom-\nena are observed with FF\u2013CHCl3/isopropanol (3 %), FF\u2013\nCH2Cl2/DMF (3 %), FF\u2013benzene, FF\u2013styrene, FF\u2013xylene,\nand FF\u2013CCl4/DMF (2 %) systems. SEM images (Figures S4\nand S5) illustrate the crystallization process, demonstrating\nthat the gel\u2013crystal transition also occurs in other gel systems.\nIn the case of FF\u2013CHCl3/isopropanol (3 %), the transparent\ngel became opaque after only two cryogenic treatments,\npossibly because the solvent\u2013gelator interactions were much\nweaker than those in the FF\u2013toluene system, resulting in\nmuch easier separation of the solvent and FF assembly and\nmore facile formation of the FF crystal. We also tested two\nother organogel systems (cationic diphenylalanine (CDP) and\nphenylalanine (F)) and observed similar transitions (Figur-\nes S6 and S7). These findings demonstrate the versatility of\nour method.\nIn summary, we have developed a universal approach for\nmodulating the gel\u2013crystal transition of a dipeptide assembly.\nCryogenic treatment disrupted and reestablished the balance\nbetween the molecular interactions within a newly prepared\ngel, resulting in the formation of a dipeptide hexagonal\ncrystal. Remarkably,\nexhibited\nenhanced emission, which may be due to the limited vibra-\ntional relaxation of the intermolecular bonds in the assembly.\nFigure 3. Characterization of FF\u2013toluene organogels after different\nnumbers of cryogenic treatments (0, 5, 10, and 16): a) Rheological\ndata, b) FTIR spectra, c) XRD patterns, and d) CD spectra.\nFurthermore, the entire evolution process was studied by\nX-ray diffraction (XRD; Figure 3 c). Before treatment, the\nxerogel exhibited a lamellar structure, with a peak at 2 q =\n5.1488 (lamellar thickness = 16.9 c),[17] indicating that the gel\nwas not crystalline. After five treatments, some weak peaks\nappeared, revealing the formation of a small amount of\ncrystallites. Ten cycles later, more small peaks had arisen, the\nintensity of the previously observed peaks had increased, and\nthe peaks had become sharp, implying crystal formation.\nWhen the number of cycles was increased to sixteen or even\nthirty (Figure S1 b), the sharp peaks did not change anymore,\nconfirming the completion of the gel\u2013crystal transition. After\n16 cycles, a hexagonal structure with crystalline properties\nwas observed.[37, 38] These findings are in good agreement with\nthe SEM results. Collectively, these results imply that the\ncryogenic treatment caused the gel\u2013crystal transition. By\ncontrast, without the cryogenic treatment, no obvious changes\nwere observed in the FF\u2013toluene system (see Figure S2).\nFurthermore, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was\nused to examine the secondary structure of the gels after the\ncryogenic treatment (Figure 3 d). Clearly, without treatment,\nthe gel did not show any CD signals because the gelators did\nnot form a chiral supramolecular assembly. After more than\nfive treatments, the CD spectra exhibited a single negative\nband with a peak at 278 nm, which was fit to l-Phe-l-Phe.\nMoreover, the peak intensities increased with an increasing\nnumber of\ncryogenic treatment changes the intermolecular arrangement\nin the gel, and that the FF hexagonal crystal is chiral.\nFor LMWGs, the solvophobic moieties of the molecules\ntend to aggregate. Meanwhile, a balance exists between the\nsolvophobic and solvophilic parts to facilitate the formation\nof nanostructures and enable gelator\u2013solvent interactions.\nWhen the gelator is too solvophobic, the gel may crystallize or\nprecipitate.[28] In our case, FF is easily dissolved in HFIP but it\nis insoluble in toluene. Thus, after toluene had been added to\nthe FF/HFIP solution, a transparent gel was formed imme-\ndiately. In the temperature range from 77 K to room temper-\nThis strategy can be generalized to achieve gel\u2013crystal\ntransitions in other FF-based organogels. These findings will\nbe useful to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship\nbetween gelation and crystallization in self-assembled sys-\ntems and to achieve the controlled assembly and versatile\nfunctionalization of single-component materials."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"peptide_sequence\": \"FF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"organogel\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"4/96 HFP/Toluene\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"5.0\", \"PH\": \"7.0\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"nan\"}"}]}

The grids were then stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate\nfor another 2 min before analysis using a Hitachi (Tokyo, Japan) H-7000\ntransmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of\n75 kV. A sample of 2% (w/v) Ile-Phe gel smeared on a 1-cm slide was\nallowed to dry at room temperature, followed by gold coating, before being\nimaged on a Hitachi S-570 scanning electron microscope.\nCongo red (CR) was diluted in a buffer containing 5 mM sodium phosphate\nand 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.0, to obtain a stock of 100 mM CR. A 2% (w/v) Ile-\nPhe gel was formed in the presence of 5 mM CR \ufb01nal concentration. A gel\nsample was placed on a microscope slide and sealed. The CR birefringence\nwas detected under cross-polarized light using an optic microscope (Leica\nDMRB, Heidelberg, Germany).\nDiluted, gelled, and air-dried dipeptide samples were used for FTIR spectro-\nscopy analysis. Exchangeable hydrogen atoms were replaced by deuterium\nby dissolving the dipeptide stocks in D2O. Infrared spectra were recorded\nwith an FTS-6000 FT-IR spectrophotometer (BioRad, Hemel Hempstead,\nUK) equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury/cadmium telluride\ndetector and purged with a continuous \ufb02ow of nitrogen gas or with a Bruker\nTensor 27 FT-IR spectrometer. For each spectrum, 200 interferograms were\ncollected and averaged. In every case, the buffer spectrum was subtracted\nand the baseline corrected. Second derivatives of the spectra were used to\ndetermine the frequencies at which the different spectral components were\nlocated. To monitor the effect of pH on self-assembly, we measured the pH\nestablished by the dipeptides themselves upon dilution in H2O, pH 5.8. This\npH was either increased to pH 12.0 by addition of 1 N NaOH or lowered to\npH 2.0 by addition of 1 N HCl to test the effect of N- and C-terminal group\nionization in Ile-Phe self-assembly.\nThe \ufb02uorescence emission spectra of TNS with the dipeptide samples were\nrecorded at 293 K in a Perkin-Elmer 650-40 \ufb02uorescence spectrophotom-\neter. TNS was diluted in H2O to obtain a 1 mM stock solution. The samples\nwere excited at 323 nm and the \ufb02uorescence emission was measured\nbetween 350 nm and 550 nm. Both excitation and emission slits were set at\n10 nm. To follow the Ile-Phe dipeptide kinetic self-assembly by TNS\nbinding, a 2% Ile-Phe sample in a solution containing a \ufb01nal 10 mM TNS\nconcentration was heated to 333 K and then cooled gradually to 278 K.

To study the dependence of peptide\nself-assembly on concentration, the turbidity was measured at 293 K. To\nstudy the dependence of peptide assembly state on the temperature, each\nsample was \ufb01rst heated to 333 K or cooled to 283 K before measuring the\nreassembly or disassembly, respectively. These samples were subsequently\ncooled or heated in 5-K stages and equilibrated for 15 min before measuring\nthe turbidity at each assayed temperature."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"peptide_sequence\": \"IF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"none\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"2/98 HFP/H2O\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"0.2\", \"PH\": \"5.8\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"nan\"}, {\"peptide_sequence\": \"IF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"none\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"2/98 HFP/H2O\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"1.0\", \"PH\": \"5.8\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"nan\"}, {\"peptide_sequence\": \"IF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"fiber\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"2/98 HFP/H2O\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"10.0\", \"PH\": \"5.8\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"nan\"}, {\"peptide_sequence\": \"IF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"fiber\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"2/98 HFP/H2O\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"20.0\", \"PH\": \"5.8\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"nan\"}, {\"peptide_sequence\": \"VF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"none\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"2/98 HFP/H2O\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"0.2\", \"PH\": \"5.8\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"nan\"}, {\"peptide_sequence\": \"VF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"none\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"2/98 HFP/H2O\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"1.0\", \"PH\": \"5.8\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"nan\"}, {\"peptide_sequence\": \"VF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"none\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"2/98 HFP/H2O\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"10.0\", \"PH\": \"5.8\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"nan\"}, {\"peptide_sequence\": \"VF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"none\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"2/98 HFP/H2O\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"20.0\", \"PH\": \"5.8\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"nan\"}]"}]}

R. China.\n\nTransition of Cationic Dipeptide Nanotubes into Vesicles and\nOligonucleotide Delivery**\nXuehai Yan, Qiang He, Kewei Wang, Li Duan, Yue Cui, and Junbai Li*\nThe self-assembly of biocompatible molecules,\nsuch as peptides and proteins, into regular supra-\nmolecular structures has important implications. In\na sense these molecules mimic biological sys-\ntems.[1, 2] Additionally, such biomimetic systems\nare becoming important for the delivery of drugs,\ngenes, and proteins. Peptide-based nanostructures\nhave attracted considerable attention owing to\ntheir biocompatibility, capability of molecular\nrecognition, and well-defined structures.[3\u201310] For\nexample, G\u2019rbitz first found that simple dipeptides\ncan self-assemble into nanotubes, and that the\nresulting structures have chiral hydrophilic chan-\nnels with a Van der Waals diameter of up to\n10 +.[10a] Reches and Gazit showed that very short\ndipeptides with the b-amyloid diphenylalanine structural\nmotif associated with Alzheimer-s disease can form long,\nstiff nanotubes by self-assembly, and that these nanotubes can\nbe used as scaffolds to produce discrete silver nanowires.[6]\nSubsequently, Song et al. simplified the synthesis of the\ndipeptide nanotubes (DPNTs) and observed that DPNTs\nturned into vesicles when the DPNT dispersion was diluted by\nadding water.[8] Zhang and co-workers also reported that\nlinear surfactant-like oligopeptides self-assembled simulta-\nneously into nanotubes and vesicles.[7, 9] Such peptide nano-\ntubes (PNTs) can be used for intracellular-delivery applica-\ntions. Herein, we report that cationic dipeptides (H-Phe-Phe-\nNH2\u00b7HCl; see Figure 1) self-assemble into nanotubes at\nphysiological pH values, and that these cationic dipeptide\nnanotubes (CDPNTs) can also rearrange to form vesicles\nupon dilution. Moreover, the CDPNTs can traverse cell\nmembranes and be absorbed by the cells upon spontaneous\nconversion into vesicles. We utilized this property to deliver\noligonucleotides into the interior of cells as an indication of\nthe potential applications of the system in gene and drug\ndelivery.\nWe selected cationic dipeptides to fabricate nanotubes so\nthat negatively charged nucleic acids could be bound to the\ntubes and then delivered into cells. The CDPNTs were self-\nassembled at physiological pH values (see experimental\nsection in the Supporting Information). A scanning electron\nmicroscopy (SEM) image showed that the nanotubes are\nquite homogeneous with lengths of tens of micrometers\n(Figure 2 a). The inset in Figure 2 a shows a typical tubular\nstructure at a larger magnitude. A transmission electron\nFigure 2. a) SEM image of the CDPNTs (inset: a hollow nanotube at\ngreater magnification); b) TEM image of the CDPNTs; c) height AFM\nimage (area: 5 mm 0 5 mm) of the CDPNTs; the cross-sectional profile\nof a nanotube shows its height of approximately 190 nm.\nmicroscopy (TEM) image confirmed that tubes had formed\nwith a diameter of approximately 200 nm (Figure 2 b). To\nobtain direct topographical information, the samples were\ndeposited on a mica surface and investigated by atomic force\nmicroscopy (AFM; Figure 2 c). The height of the nanotube\nshown is about 190 nm, as estimated from its cross-sectional\nprofile. All of these results confirm that the cationic dipeptide\ncan self-assemble into tubes at pH 7.2.\nWe find that the CDPNTs transform gradually into\nvesicles when the CDPNT dispersion is diluted under neutral\nconditions. As observed by optical microscopy, the CDPNTs\ndisappear with time, and the number of vesicles increases\nsimultaneously (Figure 3 a). To verify the structures of the\nvesicles (the black dots in Figure 3 a), the solution was diluted\nFigure 3. a) Observation through an optical microscope of the conver-\nsion of the CDPNTs (as a dispersion in PBS at pH 7.2) into peptide\nvesicles; b) CD spectra of the CDPNTs and vesicles at different\nconcentrations (A: 10, B: 8, C: 7, D: 5, E: 2, F: 1 mg mL(cid:1)1); c),d) TEM\nimages of negatively stained CDPNTs at a concentration of 7 and\n5 mg mL(cid:1)1, respectively; e) CD spectra of zwitterionic DPNTs at differ-\nent concentrations (A: 10, B: 5, C: 2 mg mL(cid:1)1).\nfurther with pure water to a final concentration of 1 mg mL(cid:1)1.\nThese diluted samples were then characterized by negative-\nstaining TEM and AFM (see the Supporting Information).\nThe TEM image showed that peptide vesicles are formed\nafter dilution of the nanotube dispersion. Analysis by AFM\nconfirmed the three-dimensional, spherical shape of the\nnanostructures. The cross-sectional profile of the vesicles\nshowed that the peptide vesicles are approximately 100 nm in\nheight, which is consistent with the TEM analysis. All of the\nabove results confirm that the CDPNTs can convert sponta-\nneously into vesicles when diluted at physiological pH values.\nTo further clarify this transition process, circular dichro-\nism (CD) spectroscopy was used to determine changes in the\nsecondary structure during the conversion of the self-assem-\nbled CDPNTs into vesicles. CD spectra of the CDPNTs and\nvesicles at different concentrations show that the CDPNT-to-\nvesicle transition causes a change in the secondary structure\nof the peptide aggregations (Figure 3 b). The observed CD\ncurve of the assembled CDPNT (10 mg mL(cid:1)1) has some\nsimilarities with the CD signature of a-helical polypeptides,\nand the observed extrema may be indicative of transitions\nfound in a-helical peptides. The maximum at 192 nm and the\nminimum at 206 nm correspond to the a-helical p!p*\ntransitions. Another absorption peak at 232 nm may corre-\nspond to n!p* transitions of helical arrangements of the\nPNTs.[11, 12] The CD signal reflects the interactions between\nthe three-dimensional aromatic stacking arrangement and the\nhydrogen-bonded cylinders of peptide main chains.[13] When\nthe CDPNT dispersion was diluted to a concentration of\n7 mg mL(cid:1)1, the minimum peaks for the b sheets of the peptide\nnanostructures were observed at 206 nm and 212 nm.[14, 15]\nWhen the concentration was decreased further, these peaks\ndisappeared gradually. At 1 mg mL(cid:1)1, the secondary structure\nof CDPNT vanished.\nAlthough the CD spectra of the self-assembled structures\nhave not yet been assigned completely, they demonstrate that\ndilution indeed results in a change in the peptide nano-\nstructures. Furthermore, TEM images show that at a concen-\ntration of 8 mg mL(cid:1)1, the system maintains a tubular structure\n(see the Supporting Information). However, when the\nsolution is diluted to 7 mg mL(cid:1)1, vesicles start to form and\ncoexist with the tubular structures (Figure 3 c). The ratio of\npeptide vesicles to nanotubes becomes larger upon a further\ndecrease in the concentration to 5 mg mL(cid:1)1. The intermedi-\nate state of the conversion of CDPNTs into vesicles can be\nobserved directly (Figure 3 d). When the concentration of the\nsystem was decreased to 1 mg mL(cid:1)1, the transition is com-\nplete, and the system is composed entirely of vesicles. (see the\nSupporting Information). The transition from tube to vesicle\noccurs at a concentration of approximately 7 mg mL(cid:1)1, which\nis consistent with the CD results.\nFor comparison, we chose a zwitterionic dipeptide,\ndiphenylalanine (l-Phe-l-Phe),\nsimilar experiments\nunder the same conditions. We found that this dipeptide\ncould self-assemble into nanotubes at a concentration of\n10 mg mL(cid:1)1 (see the Supporting Information). This self-\nassembly is similar to results reported previously.[6] A clear\nCotton effect is observed at 232 nm in the CD spectra of these\nzwitterionic DPNTs at a concentration of 10 mg mL(cid:1)1 (Fig-\nure 3 e). Upon a decrease in the concentration of these\nzwitterionic DPNTs, the intensity of the CD signal at 232 nm\ndecreases dramatically. When the concentration of the system\nis decreased to 2 mg mL(cid:1)1, no new peak appears. This result\nindicates that within this concentration range the zwitterionic\ndipeptide forms mainly tubular structures rather than vesicles,\nunlike the cationic dipeptide, for which the transition from\nnanotubes to vesicles can be observed at a concentration of\n7 mg mL(cid:1)1.\n 15213773, 2007, 14, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.200603387 by Massachusetts Institute of Technolo, Wiley Online Library on [21/03/2024].

Analysis of the fluorescence-inten-\nsity distribution on an individual nanotube (Figure 4 b) shows\nthat the fluorescence remains mainly on the sidewalls of the\nnanotubes (see inset in Figure 4 b). Furthermore, peptide\nvesicles formed from CDPNTs retain the green fluorescence\n(the green dots in Figure 4 c, in contrast with ssDNA alone in\nFigure 4 d), which indicates that the ssDNA is localized on the\npeptide vesicles after the conversion of the CDPNTs. We also\ninvestigated the ability of CDPNTs to inhibit the migration in\ngel electrophoresis of ssDNA. When the volume ratio of\nCDPNTs to ssDNA was changed to 3:1 (see the Supporting\nInformation), the migration of ssDNA in gel electrophoresis\nwas inhibited. This observation indicates that ssDNA can be\nimmobilized securely on the cationic dipeptide nanostruc-\ntures through electrostatic interactions. In contrast, zwitter-\nionic DPNTs and cationic dipeptide molecules in solution\nwithout aggregation have no effect on the migration of\nssDNA in gel electrophoresis at different volume ratios (see\nthe Supporting Information), which indicates that ssDNA\ndoes not bind to zwitterionic DPNTs and free cationic\ndipeptides. These results confirm that ssDNA can be bound\nto the cationic dipeptide nanostructures through charge\ninteractions, which are very important for the immobilization\non the nanostructures and intracellular release of DNA.[16, 17]\nThe dispersion of the CDPNT/ssDNA complexes was\ndialyzed for 2 h with constant stirring in phosphate buffer\nsaline (PBS) to eliminate cytotoxic hexafluoro-2-propanol.\nWe then studied the interaction of the resulting complexes\nwith HeLa cells. CDPNTs labeled with Congo red (CR-\nCDPNTs) were used for the control experiment of cellular\nuptake. It was found that Congo red does not influence the\ntubular structure of the cationic dipeptide (see the Supporting\nInformation). Both TEM and confocal-microscopy images\nconfirmed the stability of CDPNTs in the presence of Congo\nred. The HeLa cells were incubated with CR-CDPNTs and\nCDPNTs/ssDNA (c(CDPNTs) (cid:3) 0.5 mg mL(cid:1)1)\nin a cell-\ngrowth medium with 5 % CO2 at 37 8C for 24 h. The\nmedium containing CR-CDPNTs or the complexes was then\nremoved, the cells were rinsed gently twice, and a fresh\nculture medium was added. Subsequently, the cells were\nimaged directly in glass-bottomed Petri dishes by CLSM.\nCLSM scans normal to the dish plane revealed that fluores-\ncence originated mainly from the interior of\nthe cells\n(Figure 5; see also the Supporting Information). This result\nindicates that the CR-CDPNTs and CDPNT/ssDNA enter\nthe cells by converting into vesicles and accumulate in the\ncytoplasma of the cells. No significant cell death was observed\nwhen HeLa cells were incubated under the conditions\ndescribed above. As negative-control experiments, cells\nwere incubated with a solution that contained zwitterionic\nFigure 5.

No fluores-\ncence of the cells was detected by CLSM (see the Supporting\nInformation), which means that the CDPNTs can traverse cell\nmembranes by converting spontaneously into vesicles, and\nthat they can transport ssDNA into the cells.\nThe self-assembly of cationic dipeptides is driven by\nhydrogen bonding and by p\u2013p stacking interactions, as\ndescribed by Reches and Gazit for the self-assembly of\naromatic dipeptides into nanotubes.[6] Zhang and co-workers\npointed out previously that the self-assembly and disassembly\nprocesses of linear surfactant-like peptide nanostructures are\ndynamic over time.[7a] On the basis of molecular simulations\nof the d-Phe-d-Phe dipeptide, Song et al. suggested that the\nconcentration of the peptide is key to the self-assembly\nprocess of PNTs.[8] The conversion of CDPNTs into vesicles\nalso appears to be a dynamic process. When the concentration\ntheir disassembly occurs\nprobably as a result of electrostatic repulsion rather than\nhydrogen bonding or p\u2013p stacking interactions between\npeptide molecules. As observed under the optical microscope,\nvesicles of relatively incompact stacking are formed rapidly\nby peptide reassembly. Modeling and simulation studies of\nthis process are still required for further understanding. As for\nthe mechanism of cellular uptake of the CDPNTs, we propose\nthat their intracellular internalization occurs by endocytosis\nof the reassembled vesicles (Figure 1), which is a well-known\nmechanism for many species.[18\u201322]\nIn summary, self-assembled positively charged DPNTs\nunderwent spontaneous conversion into vesicles upon dis-\npersion dilution. CDPNTs with fluorescently labeled ssDNA\nbound electrostatically could enter cells readily, most likely\nafter conversion into vesicles with attached ssDNA. The\nfluorescently labeled ssDNA accumulates in the cytoplasm of\nthe cells after internalization. Thus, because of their biocom-\npatibility, bioabsorption, and recyclability, it may be possible\nto exploit the peptide nanostructures as a new class of\nmolecular transporter for the delivery of a wide range of\nforeign substances, such as drugs, genes, and proteins."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"peptide_sequence\": \"FF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"tube\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"8/92 HFP/H2O\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"10.0\", \"PH\": \"7.2\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"nan\"}"}]}

Briefly, a solution of vitamin E\u2013TPGS in min-\neral  oil  (100  mL,  0.4%  w/v)  was  prepared  and  heated  at \n35oC, subsequently drop wise addition of aspirin-loaded pep-\ntide  nanostructures  (5  mg  in  1  mL  water)  to  the  vitamin  E-\nTPGS  solution  was  done  with  continuous  stirring  at  1400 \nrpm  to  form  water  in  oil  emulsion  (w/o  emulsion).  After \nemulsification, solution was stirred for 2 h at 4oC to stabilize \nthe  Vitamin  E-TPGS  coated  nanoparticle  through  self-\nassembly. The resulting suspension was diluted with hexane \nto make the final concentration of 20% (v/v). The suspension \nwas  centrifuged  and  the  organic  layer  was  removed.  The \naqueous layer was washed three times with hexane (1mL) to \nremove  the  remaining  mineral  oil  and  followed  by  vacuum \ndrying. The same procedure was repeated for eosin and cur-\ncumin loaded nanostructures. \nTo study the interaction of drugs with peptide nanostruc-\ntures,  fluorescence  assay  was  performed  following  reported \nprocedure [21]. Briefly, 20 \u00b5L of 4, (10 mg/mL in methanol) \nwas added to aqueous solution of eosin (10 \u00b5M, 190 \u00b5L) and \nvortexed  for  1  min.  Emission  fluorescence  spectra  of  the \nresulting  solution  (excitation  wavelength  518  nm)  was  re-\ncorded  in  the  range  from  540  to  600  nm  using  spectro-\nfluorimeter (Fluoromax-4, Horiba) at different time intervals.  \nThe release studies of entrapped drugs were done by tak-\ning the above vitamin E-TPGS stabilized samples (\u0334 5mg) in \na dialysis membrane (MWCO 500-1000 Da). The membrane \nwas  placed  in  a  beaker  containing  50  mL  of  distilled  water \n(ELIX) stirred at a speed of 100 rpm. Aliquots of 1mL were \ntaken out  at fixed  time  intervals from the beaker and absor-\nbance  of  the  samples  was  read  at  wavelength  295  nm  for \naspirin and 517 nm in case of eosin using UV-Visible Spec-\ntrophotometer.  \nIn vitro cytotoxicity assay of void peptide nanostructures, \ncurcumin  loaded  peptide  nanostructures,  TPGS  stabilized \nvoid  peptide  and  TPGS  stabilized  curcumin  loaded  peptide \nnanostructures  was  performed  in  cancerous  MCF-7  (human \nbreast  cancer) and normal HaCaT (human keratinocyte) cell \nlines  by  MTT  colorimetric  assay.  Briefly  5000  cells/well \nwere plated in a 96-well plate. These cells were treated with \nvoid  peptide  nanostructures  and  curcumin  loaded  peptide \nnanostructures in range of 3.2 - 64 \u03bcg/mL and a range of 10 - \n100  \u03bcg/mL  was  used  for  TPGS  stabilized  void  peptide \nnanostructures and TPGS stabilized curcumin loaded peptide \nnanostructures.  These  cells  were  exposed  to  above  nanos-\ntructures  for  24  h  and  subsequently  100  \u03bcL  of  MTT \n(1mg/mL)  in  DMEM  was  added  to  wells.  The  cells  were \nincubated  for  2h  at  37\u00b0C.  The  formazan  crystals  so  formed \nwere  solubilized  in  DMSO.  The  intensity  of  the  color  was \nmeasured  spectrophotometrically  at  540  nm  on  an  ELISA \nplate  reader.  The  untreated  cells  were  taken  as  control.  The \ncell viability was calculated using the formula: Cell Viability \n(%) = (Abs)treated / (Abs)control x 100  \nMolecular  self-assembly  offers  unique  directions  for  the \nfabrication of novel supramolecular structures and advanced \nmaterials.  Peptide-based  nanostructures  indicate  an  impor-\ntant route toward the production of ordered nanostructures as \nseveral  studies  have  demonstrated  their  ability  to  form  well \norganized  assemblies.  Small  and  modified  peptides  have \nbeen  reported  to  self-assemble  through  various  interactions \ninto shape-specific nanostructures such as micelles, vesicles, \nnanospheres,  nanotubes,  and  other  morphologies.  Most  of \nthe  small  peptides  have  aromatic  residues,  which  facilitate \nself-assembly  via  hydrophobic  and \u03c0 -\u03c0  interactions  making \nless soluble  in  aqueous systems  and thus hampering several \npotential  applications.  To  address  these  concerns,  sincere \nefforts have been  made by introducing surface modification \nor stabilization by surfactants [23-25]. In the present investi-\ngation,  we  synthesized  a  protected  tripeptide  (4),  Boc-Pro-\nPhe-Gly-OMe,  by  the  standard  solution  phase  peptide  syn-\nthesis  method  using  L-amino  acids  (Scheme  1)  and  charac-\nterized  by  mass  and  1H-NMR.  The  peptide  self-assembly \nwas carried out in aqueous solutions.  \nThe peptide self-assembly was triggered by adding water \nto a methanolic solution of peptide (4) and vortexing resulted \nin the formation of nanostructures, which were analyzed by \nDLS (Table 1  and Fig. 1c).  The average size of the peptide \nnanostructure  was  found  to  be  119.6  nm.  Similar  results \nwere  obtained  when \ntrifluoroethanol (TFE) followed by addition of water to form \nnanostructure  of  average  size  117.5  nm.  The  morphology \nand size of the nanostructures were also confirmed by TEM. \nThe self-assembled peptide nanostructures displayed spheri-\ncal  sized  particles  of  77.37  nm  and  72.08  nm  in  methanol-\nwater and TFE-water systems respectively (Fig. 1 a, b). The \nsmaller  size  of  self-assembled  nanostructures  in  TEM  com-\npared  to  DLS  might  be  due  to  measurement  of  hydrody-\nnamic diameter in DLS, which measured the size of swollen \nnanostructures [26,27]. \nIn  order  to  evaluate  the  encapsulation  of  hydrophobic \nmolecules  in  the  self-assembled  nanostructures,  eosin,  aspi-\nrin and curcumin were subjected to encapsulation. DLS stud-\nies  of  the  nanostructures  after  encapsulation  were  also  car-\nried out (Table 1). In comparison to the unloaded nanostruc-\ntures the average size of the nanostructures was found to be \nhigher  after  loading  the  compounds.  The  data  showed  that \nafter  loading,  the  size  of  the  drug-loaded  nanostructures  in-\ncreased from 119.6 nm to 135.5 nm, 217.1 nm and 143.9 in \ncase of eosin, aspirin and curcumin, respectively. The encap-\nsulation occurred due to the hydrophobic-hydrophobic inter-\nactions which confirmed the presence of hydrophobic matrix \nin self-assembled nanostructures. The loading of eosin, aspi-\nrin  and  curcumin  was  performed  at  different  w/w  ratios  of \npeptide:drug and it was found to be 13.8% (w/w 4:1), 33.3% \n(w/w  2:1)  and  3.84%  (w/w  25:1)  respectively.  The  %  drug \nentrapment efficiency of nanostructures was found to be 66.6 \n(eosin),  100  (aspirin)  and  0.4  (curcumin)  at  above  w/w  ra-\ntios.  The  morphology  and  size  of  the  nanostructures  were \nobserved  by  TEM  which  showed  spherical  shaped  self-\nassemblies  with  average  size  of  the  nanostructures  \u0334  72.08 \nnm, 94.97 nm and 48.29 nm in eosin, aspirin and curcumin-\nloaded  nanostructures  respectively  (Fig.  2a,  3a,  4a).  As  ex-\npected,  the  average  size  of  nanostructures  in  the  TEM  was \nfound to be smaller as compared to DLS.  \nThe  loaded nanostructures were further stabilized with  a \nbiocompatible  and  biodegradable  surfactant,  Vitamin  E-\nTPGS,  which  improved  the water dispersibility of the drug-\nloaded  nanostructures.  The  DLS  measurements  showed  that \nafter vitamin E-TPGS stabilization, the size of the nanostruc-\ntures  increased  from  135.5  nm  to  309.2  nm,  217.1  nm  to \n313.5 nm and 143.9 to 249.9 nm in case of eosin, aspirin and \ncurcumin,  respectively  (Table  1).  These  structures  were  of \nspherical  shaped  with  average  size  was  around  80.68  nm, \n116.6  nm  and  125.83  nm  in  eosin,  asprin  and  curcumin \nloaded  nanostructures,  respectively  (Fig.  2b,  3b,  4b).  The \nincrease in average  size  confirmed  the stabilization of  these \nnanostructures with Vitamin E-TPGS, which may be due  to \nthe hydrophobic- hydrophobic interaction. \nPeptide  based  nanostructures  are  an  important  class  of \nbiomaterials having potential use in tissue engineering, food \nindustry, micro fluidics and drug delivery. Loading of mole-\ncules in nanostructures  is of the main  issues  in the develop-\nment  of  drug  delivery  systems.  Different  types  of  weak  in-\nteractions  such  as  electrostatic,  hydrophobic  and  H-bonding \nhave been found to be responsible for the formation of self-\nassembled nanostructures. Here,  the  loading of hydrophobic \nmolecules  was  confirmed  by  eosin-fluorescence  quenching \nstudy.  Interaction  of  eosin  with  peptide  was  monitored  by \nemission  fluorescence  quenching  (Fig.  5).  It  was  observed \nthat  eosin  fluorescence  at  ~540  nm  got  quenched  in  time \ndependent manner. For this purpose, a solution of peptide (4) \nin methanol was mixed with an aqueous solution of eosin (10 \n\u00b5M in water) and the emission of eosin (\u03bbex - 515 nm, \u03bbem - \n540 nm) was measured at different intervals of time (Fig. 5). \nintensity  gradually \nthat  fluorescence \nIt  was  observed \ndropped at 540 nm with increasing time  intervals. These re-\nsults confirmed that loading of eosin occurred via hydropho-\nbic  interactions  between  hydrophobic  eosin  molecules  and \nthe hydrophobic moiety in peptide nanostructures [21,28,29]. \nFig. (1).

Above all, amino acids and small\npeptides are popular LMWGs since they are easy to vary and\noften show promising biocompatibility.2,3 However, intermolec-\nular hydrogen bonding networks between amide bonds alone, in\nparticular in water, are in general not su\ufb03cient to make a small\npeptide or amino acid an e\ufb03cient hydrogelator.

Therefore, we synthesized a small\nset of DKPs containing the lipophilic amino acid phenylalanine and\na variety of hydrophilic amino acids, in particular glycine (1), serine\n(2), cysteine (3), glutamate (4), histidine (5) and lysine (6) (Fig. 1).\nIn an initial experiment we were intended to verify the principle\nhydrogelation ability of cyclic dipeptides 1\u20136. Thus, we heated an\naqueous suspension containing 4 wt% of each DKP until the solid\ncompletely dissolved. Subsequently, the saturated peptide-containing\nsolution was cooled to rt or even lower. To our great delight, each\nDKP 1\u20136 formed stable hydrogels under these conditions (Fig. 2).\nDKPs 1\u20133 and 5 form opaque hydrogels. Glutamate-containing\nDKP 4 yields a transparent hydrogel (at pH 6.0 in phosphate buffer).\nThe lysine-containing DKP 6 also yields a transparent hydrogel. To\nfurther elucidate their thermal stability, we examined the sol\u2013gel\ntransition temperature of these hydrogelators systematically as a\nfunction of DKP-concentration (ESI,\u2020 Fig. S1A). Cyclo(L-Phe-L-Cys) 3\nwas the most effective hydrogelator since it formed a stable hydrogel\ndown to a remarkably low concentration of only 0.25 wt%. It shows a\nnotable high sol\u2013gel transition temperature of up to 100 1C at 1 wt%.\nIn contrast, the corresponding serine-containing DKP 2 turned out to\nbe the least efficient hydrogelator since high peptide loadings (at least\n4 wt%) are needed for a hydrogelation with a low sol\u2013gel transition\nFig. 2 Macroscopic appearance of DKP-based hydrogels; (A) cyclo(L-Phe-Gly) 1.\n(B) Cyclo(L-Phe-L-Ser) 2.

To the best of our knowledge, 1 is\nthe lowest molecular weight peptide-based hydrogelator containing\nonly proteinogenic amino acids that has been described so far.8,9\nNext, we were interested in the shape and morphology of the\nhydrogels on a nanoscale. Therefore, we prepared xerogels of the\ncorresponding hydrogels through freeze drying and performed\nscanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 3). Xerogel morphology\nof 1 showed porous, but highly ordered planes (Fig. 3A and B). Each\nplane is woven by knotted nanofibers. DKP 2 also consists of porous\nplanes (Fig. 3C and D) which contain entangled nanofibers and\npartly microcrystalline domains. DKP 3 is constructed by undefined\nnanosheets (Fig. 3E and F) while the glutamate-containing DKP 4\n(Fig. 3E and F) forms a defined porous network at pH 6.0 (in\nphosphate bu\ufb00er).\nDKPs 5 and 6 form dense lamellar sheets with bundled nano-\nfiber connections between the sheets (Fig. 3I\u2013L). The viscoelastic\nproperties of the hydrogels were investigated by rheological strain\nsweep experiments (ESI,\u2020 Fig. S2\u2013S7A). The values of the storage\nmodulus G0 are in the remarkable range of 103\u2013106 Pa. A strong age-\ndependent storage modulus was observed for the lysine containing\nhydrogel 6 which increases from 697 Pa for a freshly prepared gel\nsample to 146 kPa for a gel sample aged for 20 h prior to the\nrheological measurement. On the other hand, the freshly prepared\nsample showed the highest mechanical stability with a high critical\nstrain level of 10% deformation. Further time sweep experiments\nshowed a remarkable increase of G0 upon aging for all DKPs (ESI,\u2020\nFig. S2\u2013S7D). In agreement with comparable hydrogels, the loss\nmoduli (G00) were found to be at least one order of magnitude lower\nthan G0 indicating that the hydrogels described herein are true\nphysical hydrogels and not viscoelastic fluids.10 Frequency sweep\nexperiments of all hydrogels showed a very weak dependency on the\nangular frequency suggesting that the gel matrices have excellent\ntolerance towards external forces (ESI,\u2020 Fig. S2\u2013S7B). Furthermore,\nmost of the hydrogels (except of 2) showed a significant thixotropic\nbehaviour and thus have self-healing properties (ESI,\u2020 Fig. S2\u2013S7C).\nWe further asked ourselves whether we can tune the mechanical\nand morphological properties of the hydrogel by mixing two or more\nDKPs. Due to recent reports regarding tuneable two-component\nhydrogels based on the interaction between diamines and carboxylic\nacids,11,12 we studied the gelation behaviour of a 1 : 1 mixture\nbetween the glutamate containing DKP 4 and the lysine containing\nWe initially investigated the sol\u2013gel transition temperature of the\nblended hydrogel and found remarkable pH-dependency. While pure\n4 only formed stable hydrogels at pH 6.0 and pure 6 only formed\nstable hydrogels in basic solution (pH 8\u201311), the blend formed a clear\nhydrogel within a remarkably widespread pH-range between pH 2 and\npH 11. The sol\u2013gel temperature reaches a maximum at pH 2 (79 1C)\nand a minimum at neutral pH-values (27 1C, Fig. 4B). The viscoelastic\nproperties showed significant pH-dependency as well, which\nwas inverse to the sol\u2013gel temperatures with a maximum G0 value\nFig. 3 SEM images of xerogels.

Since  self-assembly \nof  short  peptides  is  generally  a  concentration-\ndependent phenomenon, the authors reinvesti-\ngated self-assembly of the four dipeptides, EDF, \nKDF, RDF and DDF, at different concentrations. \nDipeptides were synthesized in high yields, puri-\nfied  using  HPLC  and  characterized  by  mass \nspectrometry (Supplementary table S1). Self-assembly \nwas initiated by dissolving different amounts of \ndipeptides (1\u201310 mg) in HFIP and subsequently \nadding 1 ml of water. The formation and stabil-\nity in population was investigated by DLS and \nTEM.

Since RDF assem-\nbled into stable NPs at a relatively low concen-\ntration (0.25 mg/ml), further investigations were \nmostly focused on this dipeptide. RDF showed \na  concentration-dependent  assembly  (Figure  1b) \nwith a critical aggregation concentration below \n1 mM. Such a low assembling concentration of \nRDF  compares  well  with  other  peptide-based \nNPs shown to have drug-delivery potential  [12]. \nNPs intended for drug delivery would inevitably \nbe diluted significantly upon in vivo delivery; the \nstability of RDF NPs under different dilutions was \ninvestigated using DLS. It was observed that the \nNPs, once formed, were stable up to 100-fold dilu-\ntions and retained their particulate nature with a \nsize of 203 nm and a PDI of 0.3 (table 2). RDF NPs \nwere also stable in size, as well as polydispersity, at \npH 7.4 over a 24-h period (Figure 2b). \nStability of NPs in serum is essential for their \napplication as a drug-delivery vehicle. Moreover, \nsince RDF is cationic in nature, its interaction \nwith serum proteins may lead to charge shielding \nand aggregation. In most studies, serum stabil-\nity of NPs has been carried out in the presence \nof  10%  (v/v)  fetal  bovine  serum  [26,27],  mainly \nbecause whole serum contains many proteins and \nprotein aggregates that interfere with the DLS \nFigure 2.

This\ncrystalline morphology arises from anisotropic molecular inter-\nactions that give rise to substantial di\ufb00erences in surface\ntension at the ends and sides of the resulting crystals. Due to\nlimitations of rates of mixing, upon initial addition of water,\nvery high strengths of attraction are achieved, resulting in the\nformation of a metastable phase that is subsequently displaced\nby fiber formation.17 This initial phase is amorphous, and the\nensuing formation of an ordered phase indicates that the\ncrystalline phase has the lower free energy. Our results suggest\nthat the soft solid mechanical response of the gels arises from\nthe low number density of intermolecular (physical) bonds, and\nthe ease of repairing structures damaged by mechanical disruption\nthrough rapid dissolution and recrystallization processes is\nenabled by high surface areas of the crystals.\nTo build the case that Fmoc-FF molecules undergo a first order\nphase transition in forming fibers, we first seek to move from a\ndescription of gel line denoted by concentrations of water and\nFmoc-FF at the gel point (Fig. 1) to a phase diagram where water\nconcentration is converted to an e\ufb00ective strength of intermolecular\ninteraction and a phase diagram where transitions can be denoted\nGelation in colloidal and protein solutions has been associated\nwith rapid quenches into the spinodal of metastable liquid\u2013liquid\nphase boundary that exists for particles experiencing short-range\nattractions. The increased mechanical strength of the gels is\nassociated with low particle diffusivity in the dense, amorphous\nstate resulting in aggregation of clusters into space-spanning\nstructures. Aging and ultimate crystallization of these gels is\nthen expected (and observed) as the system slowly relaxes into\nthe lowest free energy minimum of a crystal in equilibrium with\na dilute molecular solution. The key features we draw from this\nexperimental and theoretical work are:\n(1) When molecules experience short-range attractions, as\nthe strength of attraction is increased or the temperature is\nlowered, molecules will spontaneously phase separate into\ncrystalline and dilute amorphous phases.\n(2) At the same average strength of attraction, broad classes\nof molecules have the same solubility and a coexistence region\nexists that follows a lever arm rule relating the average concentration\nof the solute to the volume of the two equilibrium phases.\nWe explore the application of these ideas to the Fmoc-FF/\nDMSO/H2O system. As the water concentration is decreased,\nhigher Fmoc-FF concentrations are required to see a gel (Fig. 1).\nFurthermore, at fixed Fmoc-FF volume fraction, increasing the\namount of water in the system results in increased elasticity.\nThese observations clearly indicate that water is responsible for\nincreased attractions between the Fmoc-FF molecules and that\nthere is a change of state of the Fmoc-FF molecules over a\nnarrow change in water concentration. Previously, we demonstrated\nthat the Fmoc-FF gel is reversible with respect to yielding upon\nintense mechanical agitation and melting with increases in\ntemperature.17,32 The fibers are observed to form and fluctuate\nin local concentration over relatively short periods of time\n(minutes to hours).33\nFmoc-FF is hydrophobic and insoluble in water, but dissolves\nto very high concentrations in DMSO (volume fractions\napproaching 0.5), resulting in stable solutions. In the presence\nof water, the peptide backbones form hydrogen bonds necessary\nto create beta sheets, while the aromatic nature of fluorenyl\ngroup and the amino acid side groups allow for p\u2013p stacking\ninteractions,5 which are highly anisotropic and short-range\nrelative to the size of the Fmoc-FF molecule. Compact or chunky\ncrystals are not formed when water is added to an Fmoc-FF/\nDMSO solution. Nevertheless, the produced fibers are ordered,5\nsuggesting that they can be treated as an equilibrium crystalline\nstate formed from anisotropic particles experiencing short-range\nin terms of the strength of attraction between Fmoc-FF molecules\nand the Fmoc-FF concentration. With this information in hand, we\ndemonstrate that the phase boundary of this molecule can be\nmapped onto generalized phase behavior seen for a variety of\nmolecules and colloidal particles that experience isotropic and\nweakly anisotropic attractions. We further demonstrate that at\nconstant strength of attraction, two phases are in equilibrium as\nthe average concentration of the Fmoc-FF molecule is increased\nabove the phase transition concentration. Finally, we show that\nthere is a weak barrier to crystal nucleation and discuss this barrier\nin terms of the quasi-one-dimensional crystal nucleation that takes\nplace in the studied system.\nBelow, we first describe theoretical and experimental studies of\nthe phase behavior of small molecules and nanoparticles and how\ndi\ufb00usivities can be used to characterize strength of interparticle\nattractions. We then proceed to describe our experimental\nmethods and discuss our results where we link di\ufb00usion to\nstrength of attraction and strength of NMR signal to freely\ndi\ufb00using molecule concentration. Finally, we draw conclusions\nabout the phase behavior of the gelator in the Fmoc-FF/DMSO/\nH2O system and propose the appropriate phase diagram.\nDetailed theoretical, simulation and experimental studies suggest\nthat short-range isotropic attractions result in a phase diagram\nwhere liquid\u2013liquid phase separation is always metastable\nrelative to a fluid-crystal phase boundary.18\u201320 The spinodal\ndefining a dilute-concentrated or liquid\u2013liquid phase separation\n(analogous to a gas\u2013liquid phase transition for single component\nsystems) is metastable and occurs at concentrations larger\n(temperatures lower) than the crystallization boundary. Studied\nextensively for colloidal particles and proteins (diameters\ngreater than 50 nm), the generalized nature of these phase\ntransition boundaries has been extended to small molecules\nand proteins experiencing anisotropic interactions.21\u201327 The\npresence of the metastable liquid/liquid phase separation has\nbeen seen in proteins and small molecule systems. These studies\nsuggest that at the same average strength of attraction, broad\nclasses of Brownian particles display very similar solubilities.27\u201330\ninteractions.

First, we make a connection to\nprevious studies showing that a wide variety of organic and\ninorganic molecules show very similar phase behavior when\ntheir solubilities are compared at the same average strength of\nattraction. Second, we show that the lever arm rule is operational\nin the gelled state. Finally, we measure the induction time for the\nformation of the fiber phase and again show consistency with\nclassical nucleation theories used to describe phase transitions of\nsmall molecules and colloids. Each of these studies provides\nevidence that the Fmoc-FF/DMSO/H2O system undergoes a first\norder phase transition to form a highly anisotropic crystalline\nphase and that the large clusters observed in solution on rapid\nmixing with water are indicative of a quench into the spinodal of\na liquid\u2013liquid phase separation that relaxes with time towards\nan ultimate equilibrium state.\nThe volume fraction dependence of the long-time self-di\ufb00usivity\nof Fmoc-FF carries information about molecular interactions.\nThe molecules di\ufb00use more slowly if they spend time in close\nproximity where they are more strongly hydrodynamically\ncoupled. Intermolecular attractions increase the time molecules\nspend at small separations, thus further slowing the rate of\ndi\ufb00usion. In the dilute limit, assuming the molecules are\nspheres, the long-time self-di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient, DS, is a linear\nfunction of molecule volume fraction:34\u201336\nwhere D0 = kT/6pma is the Stokes\u2013Einstein diffusivity assuming\nno-slip solid/fluid boundary conditions, f is the molecule\nvolume fraction, while D2 reflects hydrodynamic interactions\nbetween pairs of particles. If the particles experience attractions,\nthe pair distribution will be altered such that pairs spend more\ntime at smaller separations. Stronger hydrodynamic coupling at\nsmall separations results in smaller values of D2 (i.e. D2 becomes\nmore negative). As discussed later on, we assume that under the\ndilute conditions, the particle pair distribution function is well\napproximated as g(r) = exp[(cid:2)u(r)/kT] for r 4 s, where u(r) is the\npair interaction energy for particles of diameter s with center-to-\ncenter separation r. For u(r) we use a square well potential and\nassume the particles are spheres and interact with hydrodynamic\nmobility functions Aij(r) and Bij(r) for particles experiencing no-slip\nboundary conditions34,35 (see ESI\u2020). With these approximations we\nare able to use measurement of volume fraction dependent\ndiffusivities to extract an estimate of interparticle attraction.\nAs the particles experience anisotropic interactions, but are\nBrownian, we expect the average strength of attraction extracted\nfrom our approximations to be weighted towards the largest\nstrength of attraction.\nWhile we determine D2 in the dilute limit where DS is a linear\nfunction of f, we investigate translational di\ufb00usion in Fmoc-FF\nsolutions at conditions approaching and above the gelation\nboundary and measure the gelation kinetics of slowly gelling\nsamples using 1H NMR spectroscopy. We use the changes in static\n1H NMR signal intensity over time as a measure of the conversion\nof Fmoc-FF molecules into solid structures in the gel. Using the\nobtained data, we explore the hypothesis of Fmoc-FF fibers being\nan equilibrium crystalline state and develop a phase diagram for\nthe Fmoc-FF/DMSO/H2O system using simple fluid di\ufb00usion\nmodels and crystallization theories.\nSolid Fmoc-FF powder was purchased from Bachem (Bubendorf,\nSwitzerland) and used without further purification. Dimethyl\nsulfoxide (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) and Milli-Q water were used\nin sample preparation for rheology measurements. For NMR\nmeasurements, deuterated solvents were used (deuterium\noxide, D2O, and deuterated DMSO, (CD3)2SQO), obtained from\nCambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc. For clarity and consistency\npurposes, the deuterated solvents will be referred to simply as\nDMSO and H2O throughout the text. Fmoc-FF was dissolved in\nDMSO at the desired volume fractions, calculated by:\nAll NMR measurements were performed on a 750 MHz Agilent\nVNMRS NMR spectrometer, equipped with a 5 mm Varian\n1H{13C/15N} PFG XYZ probe. The instrument was operated\nin liquid-state mode and controlled using VNMRJ software\nv3.2A. Compositions near the gel point were chosen at water\nconcentrations xH2O = 0.25\u20130.40 (Fig. 1), ensuring a sufficiently\nlong gelation time to allow mixing and transfer to the NMR\ntubes (Z0.5 hours).\nThe solution was mixed with deuterium oxide and 700 mL\nwas transferred into a 5 mm thin wall precision NMR sample\ntube (Wilmad-LabGlass). The sample tube was immediately\nplaced into the NMR instrument and the collection of 1H\nspectra at selected time intervals was commenced. The first\n1H spectrum was taken as the reference of the fully liquid state\nat time t = 0 for each sample. The final conversion to solid of\neach sample was determined from the 1H spectrum taken after\nFig. 2 1H DOSY spectra of Fmoc-FF in pure DMSO (fFmoc-FF = 0.027). The peaks shown correspond to the aromatic protons of the molecule (see Fig. S1,\nESI\u2020 for full spectrum).\nThe self-di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cients were measured using the DOSY\ncapabilities of the 750 MHz Agilent VNMRS instrument. The\nexperiments were performed with liquid solutions at various\nFmoc-FF volume fractions in both pure deuterated DMSO and\nsolutions with deuterated water concentrations xH2O r 0.40.\nPFGSE NMR utilizes the attenuation of the echo signal from a\nspin-echo pulse sequence containing a magnetic field gradient\npulse at each period to determine the displacement of the\nobserved spins on timescales of milliseconds to seconds.38,39\nThe self-di\ufb00usivity of the spins can then be correlated to the\nattenuation of the spin echo signal (see ESI\u2020 for technique details).\nRheology experiments were performed on a TA Instruments\nDHR-3 rheometer with a Peltier plate and solvent trap, using a\n41/40 mm cone geometry. Fmoc-FF/DMSO solutions were prepared\nas previously described. As soon as water was added to the\nsolution in a vial, the sample was mixed lightly and 1.2 mL of\nthe mixture was quickly transferred onto the rheometer. The\nrotating element was lowered into the measurement position\nand the experiment was started immediately.

These short peptides have been e\ufb00ectively\nintroduced into supramolecular biomaterials through covalent\nlinking to the structure-forming component of the system.\nExamples include materials bearing the fibronectin-derived\nRGDS,30,31 or RGD32,33 the laminin-derived IKVAV34 the tyrosine\nkinase nerve growth factor receptor-derived KFG.27 and the\ncatalytically relevant35 histidine containing tripeptides (such as\nHFF).36 Another example is GHK, which is a copper-binding\nextracellular matrix derived peptide sequence that plays a role in\nwound healing.37,38\nIn this communication, we demonstrate how non-covalent\nincorporation of short functional peptides (exemplified by glycine\u2013\nhistidine\u2013lysine, GHK) into supramolecular structures can be used to\nfunctionalise short peptide hydrogels. In particular, this work\nfocuses on the design and co-assembly of a structure-forming\ntripeptide (diphenylalanine-aspartic acid, FFD)21,23 and GHK leading\nto hydrogel formation in response to complexation with copper ions.\nGHK is itself not a gelator, and FFD and DFF were selected\nas candidate structural tripeptides due to their previously\ndescribed self-assembly and charges that complement that of\nGHK. FFD and DFF were previously shown to form bilayer-like\naggregates, but do not form gels in isolation at neutral pH (FFD\nhas been shown to form a hydrogel at pH 5).23\n30 mM of GHK and 30 mM of FFD were dissolved separately\nin PBS bu\ufb00er (pH 7.4) at room temperature. Samples were\nsonicated and vortexed in order to improve solubility and\nhomogeneity. Both samples formed clear solutions. To investi-\ngate whether electrostatic interactions of the positively charged\nlysine (K) and the negatively charged aspartic acid (D) could\ninduce co-assembly, a mixture of GHK/FFD was prepared at the\nsame conditions (i.e. 30 mM of each, 60 mM total) which\nformed a clear solution (no hydrogel was formed). Interestingly,\nspontaneous hydrogel formation was observed in the presence\nof 30 mM CuCl2, suggesting that GHK complexation with\ncopper ions leads to the co-assembly and gelation observed.\nFig. 1 TEM images of all tripeptides showing random aggregates of GHK\n(A), self-assembly of FFD nanofibers (B), nanotape formation due to the\nco-assembly of FFD/GHK (C) and nanofiber formation due to the co-assembly\nof FFD/GHK after complexation with copper ions (D).

FFD (which was previously\nobserved to form bi-layered nanotubes in acidic conditions)23\nformed nanofibers at pH 7.4, Fig. 1B. Upon mixing of both FFD\nand GHK, the peptides co-assemble to form tape-like structures,\nFig. 1C. However, this co-assembly did not lead to gelation as is\ntypically observed for 2D self-assembled structures, such as\ntapes and sheets39 that are usually not able to entrap the solvent\n(in this case water) within their networks. When CuCl2 was\nmixed with the FFD/GHK mixture, networks of nanofibers were\nformed leading to hydrogel formation, Fig. 1D. The TEM images\nsuggest a rapid nucleation and growth mechanism giving rise to\nspherulite-like structures.40 Additional TEM images with di\ufb00erent\nmagnifications are presented in Fig. S1 (ESI\u2020).\nHaving established the co-assembly conditions for the\nsuccessful formation of hydrogels, we used computational\nsimulations to provide further understanding of the molecular\nresults were obtained using\nco-assembly. Computational\nGROMACS 4.5.3 utilizing the MARTINI coarse grain (CG) force\nfield. In each system, 300 peptide molecules are added (150 of\neach for mixed systems) to a 12.5 nm3 box solvated with MARTINI\ncoarse grained water. This gives an approximate peptide concen-\ntration of 200 mM, which is a factor of 10 greater than normal\nexperimental conditions, consistent with previous work in this\nfield where the increased concentration is required to accelerate\nthe simulated aggregation process.21,41,42 Each simulation is\nequilibrated for a total of 9.6 ms, with snapshots taken at initial,\nmid-point and final stages, Fig. 2. As can be seen, for GHK\n(Fig. 2A) the peptides show some clustering but overall maintain\na random arrangement. For FFD, (Fig. 2B), the peptides arrange\nthemselves with the phenylalanine rings interacting with aromatic\nside chains of other peptides. This induces the formation of a\nbilayer structure, with a hydrophobic core (FF) and negatively\ncharged hydrophilic (D) surface. This formation is already\nobserved at the start of the simulation, indicating a rapid\nhydrophobic collapse. When introducing GHK into a FFD system\n(Fig. 2C) a co-assembly is observed where GHK peptides are\norganized on the surface of the FFD structure. The computational\nresults suggest that this occurs due to the electrostatic interaction\nbetween the lysine and the anionic surface of the FFD.\nTo assess the e\ufb00ect of hydrogen bonding interactions\nexperimentally, and to assess the formation of salt bridges\nbetween D and K residues, FTIR measurements were performed\nin D2O for individual components (GHK and FFD) and for\nmixtures of both before and after complexation with copper\nions, Fig. 3A. For both GHK and FFD broad FTIR peaks at\naround 1560 cm(cid:2)1 is assigned for the deprotonated COO(cid:2). The\nshift of this peak towards a lower wavenumber for FFD/GHK is\nindicative of the formation of more ordered structures with\npossible salt-bridge formation in co-assembled mixtures.21,23 It\nis worth noting that, although complexation with Cu2+ leads to\nfiber/hydrogel formation, the FTIR spectrum does not show a\nclear shift of peak at 1560 cm(cid:2)1. This observation might be\nexplained as that salt-bridge formation becomes less significant\nafter complexation with copper ions, thus reducing the e\ufb00ective\nsalt-bridge. The appearance of the peaks in the amide I region\nindicated the presence of hydrogen bonding between the amide\nFig. 3 (A) FTIR spectra of tripeptides in isolation and after co-assembly,\nsamples (30 mM of each component) were prepared in deuterated\nphosphate bu\ufb00er pH 7.4 at room temperature.

As these peaks are present\nin only samples containing the copper, we can conclude that\nthe presence of the copper helps the assembling propensity of\nthe tripeptides resulting in hydrogelation, whilst\nhighly ordered nanostructures. There is also a shift in the\nsignal from FFD in the presence of both GHK and copper\nwhich indicates the formation of more stable structures.\nIn order to assess the role of copper ions in specific binding\nand hydrogelation, we studied the gelation ability of GHK/FFD at\ndi\ufb00erent conditions. For instance, Cu2+ concentrations were varied\n(i.e. 20, 30, 40, 50 mM) and di\ufb00erent metal ions (Zn2+, Co2+) were\nused as summarized in Table S1 (ESI\u2020) (all added as chloride salts).\nWe observed that gelation requires stoichiometric Cu2+ ions concen-\ntration (30 mM) and the gel was not formed when a lower Cu2+ ion\nconcentration (20 mM) or much higher concentration (50 mM),\nmost probably due to super saturation of the peptide-copper com-\nplexes in solution, thus preventing assembly. The lack of gelation for\nZn2+ and Co2+ demonstrates that GHK binds specifically to Cu2+ 43,44\nand this is required to enhance the peptide co-assembly leading to\nhydrogel formation. As previously reported, single crystal X-ray\ndi\ufb00raction studies revealed that copper ions binding to GHK involves\nthe N-terminal group of glycine, the nitrogen atom of the first amide\nbond, the unprotonated imidazole nitrogen from histidine, and two\noxygen atoms in water (see also Scheme S1, ESI\u2020).45\nHaving established the co-assembly conditions and ion-\nselectivity of gelation, we studied the mechanical properties\nof the formed hydrogels by rheology as shown in Fig. 3B. The\nrheology data shows that the hydrogel formed at 30 mM Cu2+\nhas an average loss modulus value of 1.5 kPa, while the\nhydrogel formed at 40 mM Cu2+ has a weaker gel with a storage\nmodulus of about 0.7 kPa. The slope of the modulus might\nindicate thickening instability of the sample when 30 mM of\nCuCl2 was used as previously reported for similar systems.46\nTo assess the importance of peptide sequence, we also\nstudied the co-assembly process in the presence of DFF instead\nof FFD, Fig. 4. Consistent with previously reported structure\nforming tripeptides (i.e., anionic amino acids are preferred at the\nC-terminus),21 no gel formation was observed for individual\ncomponents as well as for mixtures before and after the addition\nof copper ions, Fig. 4A\u2013C. TEM images (Fig. 4D\u2013F and Fig. S2,\nESI\u2020) also suggest that both individual peptide solutions and\nmixtures are unable to self-assemble to form highly organized\nstructures both in the presence and absence of copper ions. These\nresults are in good agreement with our previous21 and current\ncomputational predictions (Fig. S3, ESI\u2020).\nMolecular dynamics simulations of DFF and GHK mixtures\nshow clear di\ufb00erences when compared with FFD/GHK, Fig. S3\n(ESI\u2020). The DFF structure compared with the FFD shows similar\nbilayer formation. The introduction of GHK appears to cause\nthe collapse of the DFF structure resulting in random aggregates\nof DFF/GHK, as a result, no hydrogelation is observed in the\npresence of Cu2+. Similarly, MD simulations of FDF self-assembly\nhave resulted in a structure formation similar to that of DFF and\nFFD (Fig. S4, ESI\u2020). However, the presence of aspartic acid in the\nmiddle position in the co-assembled system disrupts the packing\nFig. 4 Optical images (upper panel) and TEM images (lower panel) of the\ncontrol (DFF) aggregation (A and D), mixed with GHK (B and E) and\nco-assembled sample after complexation with copper ions (C and F).\nof the FF dyad within the tripeptide. The loss of the intra-\nmolecular p-interactions between the phenyl groups indicates\nthat the FDF structure is not stable enough to form an elongated\nfibrillar structure when GHK is present.\nIt is worth noting that GHK has generated significant inter-\nest from the cosmetics industry, in particular as a complex with\nCu2+ which facilitates copper intake by cells to enhance enzymatic\nprocesses, wound healing and promotes angiogenesis.47,48\nIt also improves skin firmness and texture, fine lines and\nhyperpigmentation.37,38 Thus, there is clear evidence of the\nbiological activity of GHK and GHK\u2013Cu complex and it is\ntherefore considered as an additive for cosmetics and skin\ntreatments. Formulating GHK into a biocompatible tripeptide\nhydrogel may be of direct interest for cosmetics industry.\nIn summary, the cooperative co-assembly of functional and\nstructural tripeptides has been studied by combining both\nexperimental validation and computational simulations. We have\nfound that the co-assembled peptides can selectively complex with\ncopper ions, leading to structural reconfiguration from clear solution\nof nanotapes to hydrogel formation of nanofibers. GHK is a known\nbioactive peptide and the hydrogels developed here may have\napplications in wound care and cell culture, which will require\nfurther investigation. The combined computation/experimental\napproach followed here provides a generally useful approach to\nidentification of co-assembled structures of structural and functional\ncomponents based on short peptides."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"peptide_sequence\": \"FFD\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"fiber\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"100 PBS\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"12.82\", \"PH\": \"5.0\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"nan\"}, {\"peptide_sequence\": \"FFD\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"none\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"100 PBS\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"12.82\", \"PH\": \"7.4\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"nan\"}, {\"peptide_sequence\": \"DFF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"none\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"100 PBS\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"12.82\", \"PH\": \"7.4\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"nan\"}]"}]}

Fmoc-AA gels were characterized using transmission electron \nmicroscopy (TEM), circular dichroism (CD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), \nand wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). Computationally, we simulated the \nassembly of Fmoc-AA using molecular dynamics techniques. All simulations \nconverged to a condensed fibril structure in which the Fmoc groups stack mostly \nwithin in the center of the fibril. However, the Fmoc groups are partially \nexposed to water, creating an amphiphilic surface, which may be responsible for \nthe aggregation of fibrils into nanoscale fibers observed in TEM. From the \nfibril models, radial distribution calculations agree with d-spacings observed \nin WAXS for the fibril diameter and \u03c0-stacking interactions. Our analyses show \nthat dialanine, despite its short length, adopts a mainly extended polyproline \nII conformation. In contrast to previous hypotheses, these results indicate that \n\u03b2-sheet-like hydrogen bonding is not prevalent. Rather, stacking of Fmoc groups, \ninter-residue hydrogen bonding, and hydrogen bonding with water play the \nimportant roles in stabilizing the fibril structure of supramolecular assemblies \nof short conjugated peptides.\n\nPreparation of Fmoc-AA gels\u2014Fmoc-Ala-Ala-OH was purchased from Bachem, Inc.\n(Torrance, CA) and used without further purification. To form gels via a pH trigger, Fmoc-\nAA was added to deionized water, vortexed, and sonicated for several minutes. 1 eq 0.5 M\nNaOH was added and mixture was vortexed until completely clear. The mixture was then\nadded quickly to a vial containing 1 eq 0.1 M HCl, to trigger gelation.\nWide angle X-ray scattering\u2014Fmoc-AA gel samples were prepared at 10 mg/ml (final\npH = 2.6\u20132.8) by a pH trigger method (1 eq 0.5 M NaOH added to dissolve Fmoc-AA, then\n1 eq 0.1 M HCl added to induce gelation, as described above) and were spread out onto a\nquartz slide and allowed to dry for two days. Samples were run on a Scintag X1 theta-theta\npowder diffractometer with a Cu x-ray source. Peak analysis was performed using Jade\nv9.1.1 (Materials Data Inc.) software, and d-spacings were calculated assuming an x-ray\nwavelength of 1.54059\u00c5 (Cu K-\u03b11).\nTransmission Electron Microscopy\u2014Gels for TEM analysis were prepared at a final\nconcentration of 5 mg/ml (final pH = 3.3\u20133.4). Approximately 10 \u03bcl of gel was placed on\nthe shiny side of Formvar/Carbon coated 300 mesh nickel grids (Electron Microcopy\nSciences, Hatfield, PA) and was allowed to adsorb for 2 minutes. Excess solvent was\nremoved using a Kimwipe, and the grid was further allowed to air dry for 1 minute, after\nwhich the grid was washed with 10 \u03bcl deionized water for 1 minute and dried with a\nFourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy\u2014Gels were prepared at 5 mg/ml (final pH\n= 3.3\u20133.4) as described above, except D2O was used in place of deionized water in all\nsolutions. For pH triggered gels, NaOH and HCl solutions were diluted to the concentrations\ndescribed above using D2O. Gel samples were sandwiched tightly between two calcium\nfluoride (CaF2) windows (25 mm wide by 2 mm thick) and placed in line with the beam in a\ntransmission configuration within the instrument. A Thermo-Mattson Infinity Gold FTIR\ninstrument was used to collect spectra, which were averaged over 200 scans.\nCircular Dichroism spectroscopy\u2014Fmoc-AA gels for circular dichroism were\nprepared at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. ~2.5 eq of Glucono-delta-lactone (GdL), a slowly-\nhydrolyzing lactone that ring-opens to form gluconic acid, was used to acidify and hence gel\na solution of Fmoc-AA and 1 eq 0.5 M NaOH in deionized water, as described previously.27\nPrior to GdL addition, a background spectrum was taken using deionized water with 1 eq 0.5\nM NaOH added. After GdL addition and dissolution the Fmoc-AA solution was pipetted\ninto a cylindrical demountable quartz cuvette with a 0.1 mm pathlength. Spectra were\nmeasured using a Jasco J-810 CD Spectrometer every 10 minutes after GdL addition. The\ninstrument was operated with a data pitch of 0.5 nm, scan speed of 200 nm/min, and\nresponse time of 1 second. Three spectra were taken for each time point then averaged. After\nthe final time point we checked for linear dichroism (LD) artifacts by performing the scan\nagain with the cuvette rotated 90, 180, and 270 degrees from its starting position, but we\nobserved no significant change in the CD signal and thus concluded that LD effects were\nminimal. The final pH of GdL-formed gels after 24 hours was in all cases between 3.5 and\nInitial structures preparations\u2014Fmoc-AA molecules were built in TINKER.28 As\nshown in Figure 1, all the fibrils are cylindrical nanofibrils, \u201cCubic 4\u201d has 4 molecules\nplaced as a \u201ccross\u201d on each layer; \u201cCubic 5\u201d has 5 molecules with the alanines radiating\noutward; \u201cCubic 6\u201d and \u201c400 ns\u201d has parallel placed Fmoc-AAs also with alanines radiating\noutward. Except Cubic 4\u2019s fibril, the plate layers are rotated 35.9 degrees relative to the\nadjacent layer. The distance between each layer is 4.5 \u00c5 for SA and 400 ns models, and 5 \u00c5\nfor all Cubic models. A lower density of molecules on each layer (like 2 or 3 Fmoc-AA\nmolecules on each layer) will result in an unstable fibril. Specific geometrical details are\nlisted in Table S1of supporting information.\nAll simulations and calculations were performed using GROMACS 4.5.4 and 4.5.329 with\nOPLS-AA force field34,35, and applied periodic boxes with explicit water molecules. All\nstarting structures for MD simulation, except simulated annealing and replica exchange\nmolecular dynamics (REMD), were subjected to steepest descent energy minimizations with\n5000 maximum steps to remove high-energy contacts. Before the productive MD, in order to\nkeep the system stable at 300 K and 1 bar, a 100 ps NVT and a 100 ps NPT equilibration\nwere applied respectively. During the productive MD, all bonds were constrained using\nLINCS algorithm36,37; for every 10 fs, neighbors were searched in grid cells with 1 nm as\ncutoff values for short-range neighborlist, electrostatic and van der Waals; long-range\nelectrostatics were treated with the particle mesh Ewald method38 with a grid spacing of\n0.16 nm; constant temperature and pressure were maintained by coupling the system to an\nexternal bath at 300 K and 1 bar, using velocity rescaling39 and Parrinello\u2013Rahman40,\nrespectively. A 2 ps pressure coupling time was applied and the isothermal compressibility\nof water is 4.5\u00d710\u22125 bar\u22121. A leap-frog integrator with the integration time step of 2 fs was\nused.41 GROMACS OPLS-AA force field with our fitted parameters for Fmoc group was\nused for the Fmoc-AA, and a TIP3P model was applied for water.42 In SA of Fmoc-AA\nmolecules self-assembly, the initial fibril structure was the first 15 layers of the 400 ns\nmodel. The system temperature was firstly heated up from 288 to 300 K in 0.5 ns, then\nlinearly and gradually cooled down to 0 K in the following 39.5 ns. We randomly extracted\n120 frames during the temperature dropping from 700 to 290 K in SA that covered the\nconformational space broadly, and those frames were then used in REMD as initial\nstructures; a set of temperatures ranging from 280 to 600 K was estimated and preset in\norder to maintain the success rates of exchange within 20\u201330%."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"peptide_sequence\": \"AA\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"hydrogel\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Fmoc\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"100 H2O\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"5.0\", \"PH\": \"3.3\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"35.0\"}, {\"peptide_sequence\": \"AA\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"hydrogel\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Fmoc\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"100 H2O\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"5.0\", \"PH\": \"3.32\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"35.0\"}, {\"peptide_sequence\": \"AA\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"hydrogel\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Fmoc\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"100 H2O\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"5.0\", \"PH\": \"3.34\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"35.0\"}, {\"peptide_sequence\": \"AA\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"hydrogel\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Fmoc\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"100 H2O\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"5.0\", \"PH\": \"3.36\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"35.0\"}, {\"peptide_sequence\": \"AA\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"hydrogel\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Fmoc\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"100 H2O\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"5.0\", \"PH\": \"3.38\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"35.0\"}, {\"peptide_sequence\": \"AA\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"hydrogel\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Fmoc\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"100 H2O\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"5.0\", \"PH\": \"3.4\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"25.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"35.0\"}]"}]}

Previously,  we  had \nreported  a  critical  gelation  concentration  for  the  peptides  to  form  hydrogels  [13].  Nonetheless,  we \nobserved hollow nanospheres and structures resembling membrane blebs already at concentrations far \nbelow  that  required  for  gelation  (Figure  1).  For  ID3,  membrane  structures  and  hollow  nanospheres \nwere  observed  at  concentrations  of  2  and  5  mg/mL  respectively,  far  below  the  critical  gelation \nconcentration  of  10  mg/mL  (Figure  1A,B).  At this  concentration,  no  gelation  or  fiber  networks  were \nseen. For LD6, hollow  nanospheres and  membranous  blebs were  seen  at a  low peptide concentration  of \n0.1 mg/mL (Figure 1C,D), around 10 times lower than that required for gelation. Membrane structures \nwere  also  observed  for  LD6  and  AD6  at  concentrations  near  the  critical  gelation  concentration  (Figure \n1F).  For  AD6,  hollow  nanospheres  were  seen  at 5  mg/mL,  close  to the  critical  concentration  (Figure \n1E). The hollow nanospheres (Figure 1E) seem to be composed of condensed fibers. The factors that \ndrive  further  organization  of  assembled  fibers  into  nanospheres  and  meshes  are  not  yet  clear.  It  is \nlikely  that  the  process  is  controlled  by  specific  thermodynamic  parameters.  The  nanospheres  can  be \nconsidered equivalent to the hydrogel cavities that are formed at higher concentrations. The nanospheres \nformed by these amphiphilic self-assembling peptides at low concentrations have potential applications \nas natural vehicles or carriers for active and passive drug delivery.  \nThe first formulation of a theory on a strictly materialistic basis for the origin of life was Haldane\u2019s \nand  Oparin\u2019s  hypothesis  of  a  primordial  soup,  containing  all  essential  chemicals  required  to  form \nbiomolecules  of  increasing  complexity  by  a  process  of  chemical  evolution  [15].  Miller  demonstrated \nthat amino acids can be formed in a model atmosphere containing methane, hydrogen, ammonia, water \nand some other simple compounds under the influence of electric discharges and heat [16]. Miller\u2019s work \nlaid  the  foundation  for  exploring  pre-biotic  chemistry  by  using  controlled  model  environments  [17]. \nMany  of  these  gas-phase  experiments  as  reviewed  by  Rode  et  al.  point  to  the  existence  of  simple, \naliphatic  amino  acids  such  as  leucine  (L),  glycine  (G),  valine  (V),  alanine  (A),  aspartic  acid  (D)  and \nglutamic acid (E) in the primordial soup [17,18]. The Salt Induced Peptide Formation (SIPF) reaction \nin  combination  with  adsorption  processes  on  clay  minerals  provides  one  of  the  simplest  and  most \nuniversal mechanisms for production of the first peptides on Earth [17]. After SIPF reaction times of a \nfew days, heptapeptides were the largest sub-units analyzed [19]. This makes our study of self-assembling \nultrasmall  peptides,  made  of  simple  aliphatic  residues,  such  as  LIVAGD,  AIVAGD  and  IVD, \nespecially  important  in  the  context  of  better  understanding  prebiotic  chemical  evolution.  Hollow \nspheres  and  membrane  blebs  formed  by  these  amphiphilic  ultrasmall  peptides  (Figure  1A,C\u2013E)  can \nhave diameters between a few hundred nanometers to a micrometer. These self-assembled supramolecular \nstructures  may  have  very  likely  played  an  important  role  in  biological  evolution  and  speciation  by \nproviding  specialized  niches or microenvironments. The acidic pH and  high salt concentration of the \nprimordial  soup  may  have  caused  immediate  degradation  of  oligonucleotides  and  hydrolysis  of \nsensitive  compounds  [17].  In  this  regard,  self-assembled  peptide  nanostructures  that  are  more  stable \nFigure  1.  Morphological  characterization  of  the  supramolecular  structures  formed  by \naliphatic  ultrasmall  peptides  at  low  concentrations  (close  to  or  far  below  the  minimum  \ngelation  concentration)  using  FESEM.

The opacity and mechanical stiffness of the hydrogels increase with increasing peptide \nconcentration  [13].  Near  the  critical  gelation  concentration,  clear  gels  were  formed  within  hours \n(Figure  2B,C).  At  higher  concentrations,  gelation  occured  within  minutes,  giving  translucent  white \ngels with higher  mechanical  stiffness (Figure 2A). The hydrogels were shock  frozen, lyophilized and \nobserved under FESEM. Dense, interconnected networks of long, twisted helical fibers were observed \n(Figure  3).  These  long  fibers  entangle  together  to  create  meshes  that  can  entrap  water  and  form \nhydrogels. Majority of water molecules surround the peptide  fibers (hydrophilic exterior) and are not \nretained  within  them  (hydrophobic  core)  [12].  These  supramolecular  assemblies  can  be  considered  \n\u03b2-turn  rather  than  \u03b2-sheet  structures  due  to  the  helical  turns  and  twists  of  the  fibers.  This  was \nconfirmed  by  CD  spectroscopy  and  X-ray  fiber  diffraction  [12].  Each  helical  turn  in  an  \u03b1-helix \ncorresponds to 3.6 amino acids and defined \u03b1-helices are formed in water by cyclic pentapeptides [20]. \nThus,  there  is  a  general  view  that  linear  tri-  to  heptapeptides  are  restricted  by  size  to  form  helical \nstructures  in  aqueous  solutions.  In  this  context,  it  is  interesting  that  even  the  trimers  aggregate  into \nfibers with helical twists and turns. We want to emphasize that our self-assembling peptides were not \nspecifically designed to form \u03b1-helices. For instance, this  is unlike the 28-residue peptides developed \nby Woolfson et al. with a coiled-coil heptad sequence repeat that form hydrogels through longitudinal \nstacking of \u03b1-helical dimers [21]. The self-assembly of our peptides  involves distinct conformational \ntransitions from random coil to anti-parallel, helical dimer pairs, which then stack on top of each other \nto  form  fibers  [12].  The  emergence  of  these  supramolecular  structures  relies  on  the  efficiency  of \nconformational transitions, which are in turn dictated by the amino acid sequence. \nRecent  studies  on  the  physical  properties  of  hydrogels  formed  by  these  aliphatic  peptides \ndemonstrated their temperature-resistance and high mechanical stiffness that can be tuned by changing \nthe  pH,  salt  and  peptide  concentration  [13].  In  addition,  the  chemical  composition  can  be  modified \nthrough surface functionalization for conjugation of growth factors, matrix metalloproteinase cleavable \nsequences  and  cell  adhesion  factors  [22,23].  The  biocompatibility  of  the  peptide  hydrogels  with \ndifferent types of cells has also been demonstrated [13]. Thus, the peptide hydrogels can be used to make \nfunctional 3-D scaffolds for tissue engineering and injectable formulations for regenerative medicine. \nFigure  2.

Hence,  it  is  necessary  to  explore  the  effect  of  sequence \nmodification on self-assembly  and supramolecular organization of this unique class of peptides. This \nwas  done  by  replacing  the  aspartic  acid  residue  of  LD6  and  ID3  at  the  polar  C-terminus  with  an \naromatic  amino  acid  such  as  tyrosine,  phenylalanine,  tryptophan.  This  modification  had  a  marked \ninfluence  on  the  ease  of  self-assembly,  the  gelation  capacity  and  the  morphology  of  the  fibers  \n(Figure  4,5).  Of  the  six  different  sequences  with  aromatic  residues,  only  those  with  phenylalanine \nformed  relatively  stable  hydrogels  (Figure  4A,B).  IW3  formed  a  weak  hydrogel  that  collapsed  into \nsmaller  aggregates  in  aqueous  solution  within  72  h  of  formation  (Figure  4F).  The  remaining  three \nsequences, namely IY3, LY6 and LW6 only formed small aggregates in solution (Figure 4C\u2013E). These \nresults can be attributed to the formation of short, straight fibers by the  modified peptides (Figure 5). \nThe short and flat fibers are unable to entangle and make dense meshes required to effectively entrap \nwater to produce stable hydrogels. This is due to their inability to bend and curl. Some peptides formed \nstraight  fibers  with  a  flat  morphology  (Figure  5A\u2013D).  These  flat  nanostructures  are  similar  to \nassemblies observed  for fully aromatic di-tripeptides such as FF and FFF [24]. These assemblies can \nbe regarded as flat \uf062-sheets rather than \uf062-turns observed for the aliphatic sequences. \nFigure  4.

The lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen (in tryptophan) and oxygen (in tyrosine) \ncan interact with the \u03c0-electrons of the aromatic ring, giving resonance structures. The same cannot be \nsaid  for  the  phenylalanine  residue,  which  cannot  form  resonance  structures.  Also,  IF3  forms  more \nrounded,  cylindrical  fibers  compared  to the  flat  fibers  formed  by  the  other  sequences  (Figure  5E\u2013F). \nThe  round  fibers  probably  form  a  better  mesh  compared  to  the  flat  fibers.  In  addition,  a  cylindrical \nfiber  has  much  greater  total  surface  area  than  a  cuboidal  fiber  of  comparable  dimensions.  This \nincreases  the  water  retention  capacity  for  the  cylindrical  fibers  as  a  greater  area  of  the  hydrophilic \nexterior is in contact with the water molecules. \nThe  occurrence  of  aromatic  amino  acids  in  naturally  occurring  motifs  such  as  amyloidogenic \nsequences  has  led  to the  general  view  that these  residues  are  essential  for  molecular  recognition  and \nself-assembly  [25].  The  exact  mechanism  for  aromatic  stabilization  in  self-assembly  is  unclear  and \nproposed theories  include \u03c0-stacking or hydrophobic  interactions among aromatic residues. T-shaped \nstacking  of  the  aromatic  rings,  with  the  planar  surfaces  roughly  perpendicular  to  each  other  has  also \nbeen reported [24,26,27]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that aromatic amino acids are important \nfor  self-assembly  due  to  their \nincreased  hydrophobicity  and  \u03b2-sheet  propensity  rather  their  \naromaticity  [28].  Compared  to  our  aliphatic  peptides,  the  modified  aromatic  sequences  form  straight \nfibers without helical turns or twists. The introduction of a planar aromatic ring at the C-terminal head \nintroduces a certain degree of steric hindrance that prevents the formation of helical turns in the fibers. \nThis steric effect is a possible explanation for the lack of long, extended assemblies for these modified \npeptides. Furthermore, crystallographic work done by Gorbitz et al. on the FF peptide suggests that the \nassembled  nanotubes  may  be  structurally  similar  to  FF  crystals  [26].  On  the other  hand,  Gazit  et  al. \nconcluded  that  the  crystal  packing  of  the  peptide  represented  a  completely  different  molecular \narrangement  compared  to  the  individual  self-assembled  nanotubes  [29].  More  investigations  clearly \nneed to be conducted in order to determine the exact mechanism  by which aromatic residues  interact \nand influence self-assembly. \nThe  short,  straight  nanostructures  produced  by  self-assembly  of  modified  peptide  sequences  can \nprovide  the  building  blocks  for  development of  modern  nanodevices.  For  example,  Gazit  et  al.  have \ndemonstrated  the  use  of  L-diphenylalanine  peptide  nanotubes  as  degradable  molds  for  casting  silver \nnanowires  [29].  These  nanotubes  have  also  been  deposited  on  the  surface  of  simple  screen-printed \nelectrodes,  significantly  enhancing  their  sensitivity  [30].

The same\ndipeptide building block, made of D-phenylalanine, resulted in the production\nof enzymatically stable nanotubes.\nSelf-assembled nanostructures provide a key\ndirection for the controlled fabrication of novel\nnanoscopic materials and devices. Nanotubular\nstructures are particularly important structural\nelements because they may serve as nanowires\nor nanoscaffolds (1\u20134). Peptide nanotubes are\nespecially intriguing assemblies because they\nhave the scope for numerous chemical modifi-\ncations and allow the use of biological systems\nspecificity. A milestone in the production of\npeptide-based nanotubes was the demonstra-\ntion by Ghadiri et al. (2, 5) that a cyclic\noctapeptide with alternating L and D amino\nacids can form a nanotubular structure by\nself-assembly. However, the peptide nano-\ntubes that formed further assembled into an\narray of tubes that were aligned as crystalline\nmicroscopic structures (2, 5). Linear surfac-\ntant-like hepta- and octapeptides can also\nself-assemble into a network of open-ended\nfrom which nanovesicles can\nnanotubes,\n\u201cbud\u201d or \u201cfuse\u201d (3, 4). Peptide-related bis(N-\n(cid:3)-amido-glycylglycine)-1,7-heptane\nboxylate molecules were also shown to be\nassembled into tubular structures (6).\nWe observed the formation of peptide\nnanotubes while studying the ability of very\nshort aromatic peptides (hexapeptides and\nshorter) to form well-ordered amyloid fibrils\n(7\u20139). Amyloid fibrils are the hallmark of a\ndiverse group of diseases of unrelated origin,\nincluding Alzheimer\u2019s disease, type II diabe-\ntes, and prion diseases (10\u201315). Despite their\nformation by a diverse and structurally unre-\nlated group of proteins, all amyloid fibrils\nshare similar biophysical and structural prop-\nerties. On the basis of both experiments and\ntheory, we recently suggested that stacking of\naromatic residues may play a key role in the\nprocess of molecular recognition and self-\nassembly that leads to the formation of amy-\nloid fibrils (16). This proposal is in agree-\nment with the well-known role of aromatic\nstacking in the formation of chemical and\nbiochemical supramolecular structures (17\u2013\n19). According to our suggestion, the restrict-\ned geometry and the attractive forces of the\naromatic moieties provide order and direc-\ntionality as well as the energetic contribution\nneeded for the formation of such well-or-\ndered structures. In this context, we were\nintrigued to determine the molecular proper-\nties of a peptide fragment corresponding to\nthe core recognition motif of A(cid:2), the diphe-\nnylalanine element (Fig. 1A). This motif is of\nspecial interest, because several studies have\nidentified the ability of larger peptides and\nconjugated organic molecules that contain\nthis motif to inhibit fibril formation by A(cid:2)\n(20\u201322). Some of those inhibitors are current-\nly undergoing clinical trials as potential drugs\nto treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease (23, 24).\nHere, we sought to make the NH2-Phe-\nPhe-COOH dipeptide soluble at very high\nconcentrations ((cid:1)100 mg/ml) by dissolving\n1,1,1,3,3,3\nhexafluoro-2-propanol. Although the peptide\nappeared to be highly soluble in the organic\nsolvent, a rapid assembly into ordered semi-\ncrystalline structures was observed visually\nwithin seconds after dilution into the aqueous\nsolution at a final (cid:4)M concentration range.\nWe used dynamic light scattering analysis to\nassembly into supramolecular\ndetermine\nstructures within minutes at the (cid:4)M range.\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM)\nanalysis with negative staining indicated that\nthe peptide forms well-ordered, tubular, and\nelongated assemblies (Fig. 1B). The light\nshell and the dark center, as observed in Fig.\n1B, suggested hollow tubular structures filled\nwith the negative stain, uranyl acetate. Ener-\ngy-dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX) indicated\nthe presence of uranium within the assembled\nstructures\nstructures\n(fig. S1A). Smaller\ncould also be observed by TEM analysis; we\npropose that these represent smaller tubular\nassemblies or fragments of the larger nano-\ntubes. The persistence length of the nano-\ntubes appears to be on the order of microme-\nters, as evident by the microscopic observa-\ntion. The formation of the tubular structures\nwas very efficient. Almost all the assemblies\nas observed by TEM had tubular structures,\nand almost no amorphous aggregates were\nobserved ((cid:5)1%). This observation is in\nmarked contrast to other peptide assemblies\n(such as amyloid fibrils) in which a mixture\nof ordered and aggregated structures may be\nobserved. High-resolution field emission gun\nTEM (HR-TEM) (Fig. 1C) provided further\nindication of the regular structures of the tube\nwalls. The formed structures were highly or-\ndered and appeared to be rather stiff but\nwithout the usual branching and curving typ-\nical of amyloid fibrils. On the other hand, the\nassemblies show some morphological simi-\nlarity in terms of size and tubular structures to\nthe recently observed peptide nanotubes that\nare formed by much longer surfactant-like\nhepta- to octapeptides (3). These structures\nare different from the first-reported peptide\nnanotubes\nformed by cyclic\npolypeptides made of alternating D and L\namino acids (5).\nWe used scanning electron microscopy\n(SEM) to further study the tubular structures\n(Fig. 2, A and B). The nanotubes were applied\non a glass coverslip coated with gold and im-\naged by SEM. The low-magnification micro-\ngraphs of areas filled with individual nanotubes\n(Fig. 2A) further demonstrate that the tubes are\nrelatively homogeneous and evidently are indi-\nvidual entities with a persistence length on the\norder of micrometers. Figure 2C shows the\nstatistical distribution of the diameters of the\nnanotubes. The crystal structure of the diphe-\nnylalanine peptide, as formed by evaporation of\naqueous solution at 80\u00b0C, showed a crystal\npacking of aligned and elongated long hollows\nFig. 1. Self-assembly of well-ordered and elongated peptide nanotubes by a molecular recognition\nmotif derived from the (cid:2)-amyloid polypeptide.

However, our structural\nanalysis indicates that the crystal packing of the\npeptide represents a completely different mo-\nlecular arrangement compared with the self-\nstructures.\nassembled\nHigher magnification SEM analysis also in-\ndicated a typical nanotubular structure that\nresembled, to some extent, a class of peptide\nnanotubes that were recently reported (3),\nalthough our structures are apparently stiffer\nand discrete (Fig. 2B).\nTo gain insight into the molecular con-\nfiguration of the assembled structures, we\nused Fourier-transformed infrared spectros-\ncopy (fig. S2). Spectral analysis of the\nassemblies showed a sharp 1630 cm(cid:6)1 peak\nat the amide I region. This peak is consis-\ntent with a (cid:2) sheet\u2013like conformation of the\nsingle amide bond, as was suggested for\npeptide nanotubes built of larger building\nblocks (1\u2013 4 ) and for amyloid fibrils (9).\nBecause the dipeptide contains only a sin-\ngle amide bond, the vibrational assignment\nof this peak is definitive and does not rep-\nresent an averaged contribution of several\nbonds, as occurs when longer peptide as-\nsemblies are analyzed. Moreover, no other\nvibrational peaks are observed (such as ran-\ndom coil peak around 1654 cm(cid:6)1) (26 ),\nwhich further suggests a uniform confor-\nmation of all the building blocks.\nThe formation of peptide nanotubes by\nthe dipeptide is very interesting when\nviewed in the context of the mechanism of\namyloid formation. Max Perutz recently\nsuggested that amyloid fibers are water-\nfilled nanotubes (27 ). The tubular struc-\ntures formed by the dipeptides show a\ngreen-gold birefringence upon staining\nwith Congo red dye, which is consistent\nwith an organization that may be similar to\nthat of amyloid structures. Therefore,\nindicates that the extremely small core rec-\nognition motif of the (cid:2)-amyloid polypeptide\ncontains all the molecular information needed\nto mediate self-assembly into regular struc-\ntures. The context in which the diphenylala-\nnine recognition motif is set apparently dic-\ntates its assembly either into canonical amy-\nloid fibrils, as is the case of A(cid:2), or into stiff\nnanotubes, as described here.\nDownloaded from https://www.science.org at Massachusetts Institute of Technology on March 21, 2024\fTo study whether the tubes are indeed\nhollow and filled with aqueous solution, we\nadded ionic silver to the nanotubes in solu-\ntion. HR-TEM visualization followed by\nEDX analysis indicated that silver nanopar-\nticles were formed within the tubes (fig.\nS1B). On the basis of these observations,\nwe examined the ability of the nanotubes to\nserve as molds for casting metal nanowires\n(Fig. 3A). The tubes were added to boiling\nionic silver solution, and the silver was\nreduced with citric acid to ensure a more\nuniform assembly of the silver nanowires\n(28, 29). TEM analysis (without staining)\nindicated the formation of metal assemblies\nwithin the majority (80 to 90%) of the tubes\n(Fig. 3B). Proteolytic lysis of the peptide\nmold, by the addition of a proteinase K\nenzyme to the silver-filled nanotubes solu-\ntion, resulted in the attainment of individ-\nual silver nanowires (cid:7)20 nm in diameter as\nseen by TEM (Fig. 3, C and D). The diam-\neter of the nanowires is smaller than that\nof the tubes, which further suggests that\ncasting was done inside the tubular struc-\nidentity of the wire\nture. The chemical\nwas confirmed by EDX analysis (fig. S1C).\nFor other applications, such as the as-\nsembly of nanotube-based biosensors or\nhollow tubing of nanofluidic circuits, enzy-\nmatically stable nanotubes are desirable. To\nassemble such stable tubes, we used pro-\nteolitically stable building blocks based on\nthe D\u2013amino acid analog of the peptide,\nNH2-D-Phe-D-Phe-COOH. This\nformed nanotubes with the same structural\nfeatures as the corresponding L\u2013amino acid\npeptide (Fig. 4A). After 1 hour of incubation\nof the Phe-Phe peptide with proteinase K\n(0.02 mg/ml), no tubular structures were ob-\nserved by electron microscopy examination\n(as compared with hundreds of tubular struc-\ntures observed before the proteolysis). In\nmarked contrast, no notable variation could\nbe observed before and after the incubation of\nthe D-Phe-D-Phe peptide with the enzyme.\nIn light of the formation of nanotubes by\nsuch short dipeptides, we tested the ability of\nother aromatic dipeptides (Phe-Trp, Trp-Tyr,\nTrp-Phe, and Trp-Trp) under similar condi-\ntions. Nanoscale tubular structures were ob-\nserved only in the case of the Phe-Trp peptide\nFig. 3. Casting of silver nanowires with the peptide nanotubes.

We observe a lag time in the formation of the new phase indicative of the existence of a free\nMolecular gels are formed from the self-assembly of molecules\nexperiencing hydrogen bonding and p\u2013p stacking interactions\ninto anisotropic structures, typically fibers of high aspect ratios,\nwhich produce space-spanning networks that resist shear,\nresulting in a bulk material with properties characteristic\nof soft solids.1,2 A specific class of molecular gels that has\ngained considerable attention over the past decade are self-\nassembling systems based on short peptide derivatives, which\nform ordered fibrous structures, usually based on p\u2013p stacking\nof b-sheets.3 The most widely studied such molecule is the dipeptide\nfluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-diphenylalanine (Fmoc-FF).4\u201312 Addition\nof water to low-concentration solutions of this molecule in\ndimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) results in the formation of mechanically\nand thermally reversible gels with long relaxation times and\nsubstantial elastic moduli.9\u201312 Due to ease of chemical modifi-\ncations, Fmoc-FF and similar gelators provide opportunities to\ndesign materials with unique structural, optical, mechanical and\nbiological functionalities.3 The gelation mechanism in these types\nof systems remains poorly understood, limiting the general design\nof new molecules and the engineering of new products based on\nthese molecular gels for applications in tissue engineering, drug\ndelivery, nanofabrication, biosensing, etc.13\u201316\nHere we provide evidence that, when exposed to water,\nFmoc-FF molecules in DMSO undergo a first order phase\ntransition to form crystalline fibers of high aspect ratios. This\ncrystalline morphology arises from anisotropic molecular inter-\nactions that give rise to substantial di\ufb00erences in surface\ntension at the ends and sides of the resulting crystals. Due to\nlimitations of rates of mixing, upon initial addition of water,\nvery high strengths of attraction are achieved, resulting in the\nformation of a metastable phase that is subsequently displaced\nby fiber formation.17 This initial phase is amorphous, and the\nensuing formation of an ordered phase indicates that the\ncrystalline phase has the lower free energy. Our results suggest\nthat the soft solid mechanical response of the gels arises from\nthe low number density of intermolecular (physical) bonds, and\nthe ease of repairing structures damaged by mechanical disruption\nthrough rapid dissolution and recrystallization processes is\nenabled by high surface areas of the crystals.\nTo build the case that Fmoc-FF molecules undergo a first order\nphase transition in forming fibers, we first seek to move from a\ndescription of gel line denoted by concentrations of water and\nFmoc-FF at the gel point (Fig. 1) to a phase diagram where water\nconcentration is converted to an e\ufb00ective strength of intermolecular\ninteraction and a phase diagram where transitions can be denoted\nGelation in colloidal and protein solutions has been associated\nwith rapid quenches into the spinodal of metastable liquid\u2013liquid\nphase boundary that exists for particles experiencing short-range\nattractions. The increased mechanical strength of the gels is\nassociated with low particle diffusivity in the dense, amorphous\nstate resulting in aggregation of clusters into space-spanning\nstructures. Aging and ultimate crystallization of these gels is\nthen expected (and observed) as the system slowly relaxes into\nthe lowest free energy minimum of a crystal in equilibrium with\na dilute molecular solution. The key features we draw from this\nexperimental and theoretical work are:\n(1) When molecules experience short-range attractions, as\nthe strength of attraction is increased or the temperature is\nlowered, molecules will spontaneously phase separate into\ncrystalline and dilute amorphous phases.\n(2) At the same average strength of attraction, broad classes\nof molecules have the same solubility and a coexistence region\nexists that follows a lever arm rule relating the average concentration\nof the solute to the volume of the two equilibrium phases.\nWe explore the application of these ideas to the Fmoc-FF/\nDMSO/H2O system. As the water concentration is decreased,\nhigher Fmoc-FF concentrations are required to see a gel (Fig. 1).\nFurthermore, at fixed Fmoc-FF volume fraction, increasing the\namount of water in the system results in increased elasticity.\nThese observations clearly indicate that water is responsible for\nincreased attractions between the Fmoc-FF molecules and that\nthere is a change of state of the Fmoc-FF molecules over a\nnarrow change in water concentration. Previously, we demonstrated\nthat the Fmoc-FF gel is reversible with respect to yielding upon\nintense mechanical agitation and melting with increases in\ntemperature.17,32 The fibers are observed to form and fluctuate\nin local concentration over relatively short periods of time\n(minutes to hours).33\nFmoc-FF is hydrophobic and insoluble in water, but dissolves\nto very high concentrations in DMSO (volume fractions\napproaching 0.5), resulting in stable solutions. In the presence\nof water, the peptide backbones form hydrogen bonds necessary\nto create beta sheets, while the aromatic nature of fluorenyl\ngroup and the amino acid side groups allow for p\u2013p stacking\ninteractions,5 which are highly anisotropic and short-range\nrelative to the size of the Fmoc-FF molecule. Compact or chunky\ncrystals are not formed when water is added to an Fmoc-FF/\nDMSO solution. Nevertheless, the produced fibers are ordered,5\nsuggesting that they can be treated as an equilibrium crystalline\nstate formed from anisotropic particles experiencing short-range\nin terms of the strength of attraction between Fmoc-FF molecules\nand the Fmoc-FF concentration. With this information in hand, we\ndemonstrate that the phase boundary of this molecule can be\nmapped onto generalized phase behavior seen for a variety of\nmolecules and colloidal particles that experience isotropic and\nweakly anisotropic attractions. We further demonstrate that at\nconstant strength of attraction, two phases are in equilibrium as\nthe average concentration of the Fmoc-FF molecule is increased\nabove the phase transition concentration. Finally, we show that\nthere is a weak barrier to crystal nucleation and discuss this barrier\nin terms of the quasi-one-dimensional crystal nucleation that takes\nplace in the studied system.\nBelow, we first describe theoretical and experimental studies of\nthe phase behavior of small molecules and nanoparticles and how\ndi\ufb00usivities can be used to characterize strength of interparticle\nattractions. We then proceed to describe our experimental\nmethods and discuss our results where we link di\ufb00usion to\nstrength of attraction and strength of NMR signal to freely\ndi\ufb00using molecule concentration. Finally, we draw conclusions\nabout the phase behavior of the gelator in the Fmoc-FF/DMSO/\nH2O system and propose the appropriate phase diagram.\nDetailed theoretical, simulation and experimental studies suggest\nthat short-range isotropic attractions result in a phase diagram\nwhere liquid\u2013liquid phase separation is always metastable\nrelative to a fluid-crystal phase boundary.18\u201320 The spinodal\ndefining a dilute-concentrated or liquid\u2013liquid phase separation\n(analogous to a gas\u2013liquid phase transition for single component\nsystems) is metastable and occurs at concentrations larger\n(temperatures lower) than the crystallization boundary. Studied\nextensively for colloidal particles and proteins (diameters\ngreater than 50 nm), the generalized nature of these phase\ntransition boundaries has been extended to small molecules\nand proteins experiencing anisotropic interactions.21\u201327 The\npresence of the metastable liquid/liquid phase separation has\nbeen seen in proteins and small molecule systems. These studies\nsuggest that at the same average strength of attraction, broad\nclasses of Brownian particles display very similar solubilities.27\u201330\ninteractions. We explore this hypothesis by comparing the phase\nbehavior of the Fmoc-FF/DMSO/H2O system to other systems\nexperiencing generalized phase behavior.\ncan be used to measure di\ufb00usion of small molecules, as well as its\nability to provide signals of di\ufb00erent molecules in the solution\neven at low concentrations.\nThis is done in several ways. First, we make a connection to\nprevious studies showing that a wide variety of organic and\ninorganic molecules show very similar phase behavior when\ntheir solubilities are compared at the same average strength of\nattraction. Second, we show that the lever arm rule is operational\nin the gelled state. Finally, we measure the induction time for the\nformation of the fiber phase and again show consistency with\nclassical nucleation theories used to describe phase transitions of\nsmall molecules and colloids. Each of these studies provides\nevidence that the Fmoc-FF/DMSO/H2O system undergoes a first\norder phase transition to form a highly anisotropic crystalline\nphase and that the large clusters observed in solution on rapid\nmixing with water are indicative of a quench into the spinodal of\na liquid\u2013liquid phase separation that relaxes with time towards\nan ultimate equilibrium state.\nThe volume fraction dependence of the long-time self-di\ufb00usivity\nof Fmoc-FF carries information about molecular interactions.\nThe molecules di\ufb00use more slowly if they spend time in close\nproximity where they are more strongly hydrodynamically\ncoupled. Intermolecular attractions increase the time molecules\nspend at small separations, thus further slowing the rate of\ndi\ufb00usion. In the dilute limit, assuming the molecules are\nspheres, the long-time self-di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient, DS, is a linear\nfunction of molecule volume fraction:34\u201336\nwhere D0 = kT/6pma is the Stokes\u2013Einstein diffusivity assuming\nno-slip solid/fluid boundary conditions, f is the molecule\nvolume fraction, while D2 reflects hydrodynamic interactions\nbetween pairs of particles. If the particles experience attractions,\nthe pair distribution will be altered such that pairs spend more\ntime at smaller separations. Stronger hydrodynamic coupling at\nsmall separations results in smaller values of D2 (i.e. D2 becomes\nmore negative). As discussed later on, we assume that under the\ndilute conditions, the particle pair distribution function is well\napproximated as g(r) = exp[(cid:2)u(r)/kT] for r 4 s, where u(r) is the\npair interaction energy for particles of diameter s with center-to-\ncenter separation r. For u(r) we use a square well potential and\nassume the particles are spheres and interact with hydrodynamic\nmobility functions Aij(r) and Bij(r) for particles experiencing no-slip\nboundary conditions34,35 (see ESI\u2020). With these approximations we\nare able to use measurement of volume fraction dependent\ndiffusivities to extract an estimate of interparticle attraction.\nAs the particles experience anisotropic interactions, but are\nBrownian, we expect the average strength of attraction extracted\nfrom our approximations to be weighted towards the largest\nstrength of attraction.\nWhile we determine D2 in the dilute limit where DS is a linear\nfunction of f, we investigate translational di\ufb00usion in Fmoc-FF\nsolutions at conditions approaching and above the gelation\nboundary and measure the gelation kinetics of slowly gelling\nsamples using 1H NMR spectroscopy. We use the changes in static\n1H NMR signal intensity over time as a measure of the conversion\nof Fmoc-FF molecules into solid structures in the gel. Using the\nobtained data, we explore the hypothesis of Fmoc-FF fibers being\nan equilibrium crystalline state and develop a phase diagram for\nthe Fmoc-FF/DMSO/H2O system using simple fluid di\ufb00usion\nmodels and crystallization theories.\nSolid Fmoc-FF powder was purchased from Bachem (Bubendorf,\nSwitzerland) and used without further purification. Dimethyl\nsulfoxide (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) and Milli-Q water were used\nin sample preparation for rheology measurements. For NMR\nmeasurements, deuterated solvents were used (deuterium\noxide, D2O, and deuterated DMSO, (CD3)2SQO), obtained from\nCambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc. For clarity and consistency\npurposes, the deuterated solvents will be referred to simply as\nDMSO and H2O throughout the text. Fmoc-FF was dissolved in\nDMSO at the desired volume fractions, calculated by:\nAll NMR measurements were performed on a 750 MHz Agilent\nVNMRS NMR spectrometer, equipped with a 5 mm Varian\n1H{13C/15N} PFG XYZ probe. The instrument was operated\nin liquid-state mode and controlled using VNMRJ software\nv3.2A. Compositions near the gel point were chosen at water\nconcentrations xH2O = 0.25\u20130.40 (Fig. 1), ensuring a sufficiently\nlong gelation time to allow mixing and transfer to the NMR\ntubes (Z0.5 hours).\nThe solution was mixed with deuterium oxide and 700 mL\nwas transferred into a 5 mm thin wall precision NMR sample\ntube (Wilmad-LabGlass). The sample tube was immediately\nplaced into the NMR instrument and the collection of 1H\nspectra at selected time intervals was commenced. The first\n1H spectrum was taken as the reference of the fully liquid state\nat time t = 0 for each sample. The final conversion to solid of\neach sample was determined from the 1H spectrum taken after\nFig. 2 1H DOSY spectra of Fmoc-FF in pure DMSO (fFmoc-FF = 0.027). The peaks shown correspond to the aromatic protons of the molecule (see Fig. S1,\nESI\u2020 for full spectrum).\nThe self-di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cients were measured using the DOSY\ncapabilities of the 750 MHz Agilent VNMRS instrument. The\nexperiments were performed with liquid solutions at various\nFmoc-FF volume fractions in both pure deuterated DMSO and\nsolutions with deuterated water concentrations xH2O r 0.40.\nPFGSE NMR utilizes the attenuation of the echo signal from a\nspin-echo pulse sequence containing a magnetic field gradient\npulse at each period to determine the displacement of the\nobserved spins on timescales of milliseconds to seconds.38,39\nThe self-di\ufb00usivity of the spins can then be correlated to the\nattenuation of the spin echo signal (see ESI\u2020 for technique details).\nRheology experiments were performed on a TA Instruments\nDHR-3 rheometer with a Peltier plate and solvent trap, using a\n41/40 mm cone geometry. Fmoc-FF/DMSO solutions were prepared\nas previously described. As soon as water was added to the\nsolution in a vial, the sample was mixed lightly and 1.2 mL of\nthe mixture was quickly transferred onto the rheometer. The\nrotating element was lowered into the measurement position\nand the experiment was started immediately. The evolution of\nthe elastic modulus with time was measured at 25 1C, at an\noscillating strain of 0.005 and frequency 1 Hz."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"peptide_sequence\": \"DF\",

In  contrast,  the  gel\nphase  showed  absorptions  at  3318,  1681,  1645,  and  1527\ncm(cid:2)1, suggesting the formation of antiparallel b sheets.\nIn  conclusion,  we  synthesized  27  tripeptides  (combina-\ntions of Gly, Ala, and Val) for a \ufb01rst screening assay, and 6\ntripeptides for a second screening assay, to test for gelation in\norganic  solvents.  We  identi\ufb01ed  Boc-Ser-Val-Gly-OCH2Ph\n(31)  as  an  excellent  gelator  for  aromatic  solvents.  Boc-Ser-\nVal-Gly-OCH2Ph (31) yielded particularly high gelation abil-\nities  in  toluene,  with  a  minimum  gelation  concentration  of\n10 mg/ml.  The  FT-IR  data  suggested  that  formation  of  an-\ntiparallel b-sheets through intermolecular hydrogen bonding\nwas  central  to  the  generation  of  nano\ufb01bers  during  gelation.\nIdenti\ufb01cation  and  characterization  of  the  gelation  properties\nof  31 lay  the  foundation  for  developing  a  dual-functional\nmolecule  that  displays  both  catalytic  activity  and  gelation\nTripeptides  1\u201433 were  synthesized  by  the  procedure  described  in  the\ntext.29\u201431) FT-IR  spectra  of  31 were  collected  on  a  JASCO  FT/IR-4200,\nusing  a  NaCl  liquid  cell  (0.1 mm  path  length)  with  toluene  d-8.  SEM,  3D\nscanning  laser  microscopy,  and  digital  optical  microscopy  were  performed\nusing a VE-9800 SEM, a VK-9700 Generation II Color Laser Scanning Mi-\ncroscope, and a VHX-1000 (KEYENCE)

To the best of our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst report of self-\nassembly of a drug and a tripeptide into a hydrogel with distinc-\ntive nanostructure that allows for controlled release of the drug.\nThese materials were used to challenge cultures of Staphylococcus\naureus, Escherichia coli, and a clinical isolate of Klebsiella pneumo-\nniae [34]. Sustained drug release from the hydrogels was re\ufb02ected\nby antibiotic concentrations of the surrounding solutions and by\nPheeWang resin, O-Benzotriazole-N,N,N,N0-tetramethyl-uronium-hexa\ufb02uoro-\nphosphate (HBTU), and Fmoc protected L-phenylalanine were purchased from GL\nBiochem Ltd (China). Fmoc-protected D-leucine and D-valine were purchased from\nMimotopes (Australia). All solvents purchased were of analytical grade from Merck\n(Australia). Piperidine, tri\ufb02uoroacetic acid (TFA), diisopropyl ethyl amine (DIPEA)\nwere from Acros (Australia). Sodium dihydrogen phosphate, disodium hydrogen\nphosphate, and sodium hydroxide were from BDH AnalaR (Australia). Cipro\ufb02oxacin\nwas purchased from Biochemika (SigmaeAldrich, Australia). L-phenylalanine (Phe),\nD-leucine (DLeu), and Thio\ufb02avin T were from Sigma (Australia). High purity Milli-Q-\nwater (MQ water) with a resistivity greater than 18 MU cm was obtained from an in-\nline Millipore RiOs/Origin system. Silicon wafers (M.M.R.C. Pty Ltd., Australia) were\ncleaned by ultrasonication (1 h) in a surfactant solution of 2% ethanol with 2% RBS 35\n(Pierce) followed by rinsing with copious amounts of MQ water and dried with\nnitrogen, then cleaned for 1 h in a UV/ozone Procleaner(cid:3) (Bioforce Nanosciences,\nUS). The HPLC (Agilent In\ufb01nity, Australia) was equipped with a quaternary pump\n(G1311B), analytical C-18 column (Luna, 5 microns, 100 \u00c5, 150 (cid:2) 4.60 mm, Phe-\nnomenex, Australia), autosampler (G1329B), diode array detector (G4212B), ther-\nmostat (G1330B) and thermostatted column compartment (G1316A). The gradient\nconsisted of acetonitrile (AcN)/water with 0.1% TFA with the following program:\nt \u00bc 0e3 min. 5% AcN; t \u00bc 18 min. 95% AcN; t \u00bc 18e20 min. 95% AcN; tR \u00bc 8 min for\ncipro\ufb02oxacin; tR \u00bc 11 min for DLeuePheePhe.\nThe tripeptide DLeuePheePhe gelled immediately following a pH trigger [32].\nBrie\ufb02y, the peptide (4.0 mg) was added to a solution of sodium phosphate 0.1 M at pH\n11.8 (buffer A, 0.3 ml), and dissolution was achieved with sonication (5 min).\nGelation was triggered by subsequent addition of an equal volume of 0.1 M sodium\nphosphate at pH 5.7 (buffer B, 0.3 ml), resulting in a \ufb01nal pH of 7.4.\n(cid:3)1 to obtain a \ufb01nal gel with 0.1% w/v\nor 0.2% w/v CIP, respectively) before adding the peptide. The resulting solution was\nthen used following the procedure described above (Section 2.3). Gelation was\nallowed to occur for 2 h, after which any residues of supernatant solution that may\nhave been present (<2% total volume, containing <1% of total CIP) were gently\naspirated with a pipette.\nThe interaction between CIP and the gelling peptide DLeuePheePhe was\nobserved by \ufb02uorescence spectroscopy. Fluorescence measurements were made\nusing a FlexStation 3 spectro\ufb02uorimeter (Molecular Devices). In order to avoid CIP\nprecipitation in the control samples (without the peptide), all measurements were\n(cid:3)1 (i.e. 0.05% w/v)\ncarried out on samples with a \ufb01nal CIP concentration of 0.5 mg ml\nand increasing amounts of the gelling peptide (0, 3.9 mM, 7.9 mM, 11.8 mM, or 15.7 mM\ncorresponding to 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% of the peptide amount used in our\nrelease studies), following the procedure described in section 2.3. Brie\ufb02y, 100 ml of\neach precursor solutions were added onto each well of a black 96-well plate.\nEmission spectra were recorded after 2 h from 380 nm to 500 nm with an excitation\nwavelength of 340 nm. At this timepoint, only samples with 50%, 75%, or 100%\npeptide formed hydrogels. Higher amounts of peptide could not be tested as they\nwould lead to peptide precipitation. Experiments were repeated twice in triplicates.\nSpectra were corrected by subtraction of the corresponding buffer signal (i.e. 0.1 M\nsodium phosphate buffer, 100 ml at pH 11.8, and 100 ml at pH 5.7).\nThe secondary structure of the peptides was analysed using a 0.1 cm quartz cell\non a Jasco J815 Spectropolarimeter, with 1 s integrations, 1 accumulation and a step\nsize of 1 nm with a band width of 1 nm over a range of wavelengths from 200 to\n270 nm. Peptide samples freshly prepared in buffer A were diluted with buffer B\ndirectly in the CD cell, and spectra were recorded after at 15e30 min. Measurements\nFT-IR spectra were collected on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer in ATR mode.\nFreshly prepared samples were left to settle for 2 h in a glass vial. A portion of the gel\nwas then transferred on a clean piece of silicon wafer (1 cm (cid:2) 1 cm), gently spread\nby pressing a coverslip on top, and dried under vacuum for 24 h. Dried samples on\nthe silicon wafers were placed directly to the ATR crystal, facing down. Scans were\nbetween 1800 and 600 cm\nDynamic sweep rheological analysis was conducted on an Ares rheometer (TA\nInstruments, USA) with 25 mm aluminium parallel plate geometry. A Peltier tem-\nperature controller was connected to the rheometer to maintain a temperature of\n25 (cid:4)C. Hydrogels were analysed after 24 h. A gap of 300 mm was set. Strain sweeps\n(cid:3)1. Frequency sweeps were recorded\nwere recorded using a frequency of 10 rad s\nusing a controlled strain of 1%. Average measurements (n \u00bc 3) have been plotted\nwith Excel.\nHydrogels were prepared as described above and after 2 h approximately 20 ml\nwere immediately placed on wells of a \u201cm-Slide Angiogenesis\u201d uncoated (Ibidi,\nGermany, through DKSH Australia). 20 ml of a solution of Thio\ufb02avin T (200 mM in\n50 mM GlycineeNaOH pH 7.5, 0.2 mm-\ufb01ltered) were placed on top. After 15 min, the\nslides were imaged on a Leica SP5 microscope (63(cid:2) water immersion objective, NA\n1.2, excitation 458 nm, emission 468e600 nm). Samples treated and stained with an\nidentical protocol but without the peptide, were used as control and did not reveal\nany of the \ufb02uorescent structures described in the text (data not shown). The video\nwas obtained with Imaris software from a z-stack of a peptide gel with 0.2% w/v CIP\nafter 48 h of self-assembly.\nA laboratory-built humidity-controlled vitri\ufb01cation system was used to prepare\nthe hydrogels for imaging in a thin layer of vitri\ufb01ed ice using cryo-TEM. Humidity\nwas kept close to 80% for all experiments, and ambient temperature was 22 (cid:4)C. 200-\nMesh copper grids coated with perforated carbon \ufb01lm (Lacey carbon \ufb01lm: ProSci-\nTech, Qld, Australia) were used for all experiments. Grids were glow discharged in\nnitrogen for 5 s immediately before use. Hydrogels were prepared as described\nabove and analysed after 2 h. Hydrogels were agitated gently with the pipette tip in\norder to liquefy them slightly if possible. Approximately 4 ml aliquots of sample were\npipetted onto each grid prior to plunging. In the case of samples which could not be\nlique\ufb01ed adequately, the gel was smeared gently onto the grid. After 30 s adsorption\ntime the grid was blotted manually using Whatman 541 \ufb01lter paper, for approx-\nimately 6 s. Blotting time was optimised for each sample. The grid was then plunged\ninto liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen. Frozen grids were stored in liquid ni-\ntrogen until required. The samples were examined using a Gatan 626 cryoholder\n(Gatan, Pleasanton, CA, USA) and Tecnai 12 Transmission Electron Microscope (FEI,\nEindhoven, The Netherlands) at an operating voltage of 120 KV. At all times low dose\n(cid:3)2 for all\nprocedures were followed, using an electron dose of 8e10 electrons \u00c5\nimaging. Images were recorded using an FEI Eagle 4kx4k CCD camera (FEI, Eind-\nhoven, The Netherlands).\nCarbon-coated 300-mesh copper grids were glow-discharged in nitrogen to\nrender the carbon \ufb01lm hydrophilic. Hydrogels were prepared as described above\nand analysed after 2 h. A 4 ml aliquot of sample was pipetted onto each grid. After\n30 s adsorption time the excess was drawn off using Whatman 541 \ufb01lter paper,\nfollowed by staining with 2% aqueous potassium phosphotungstate at pH 7.2, for\n10 s. Grids were air-dried until needed. The samples were examined using a Tecnai\n12 Transmission Electron Microscope (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) at an\noperating voltage of 120 KV. Images were recorded using a Megaview III CCD camera\nand AnalySIS camera control software (Olympus). Each grid was systematically\nexamined and imaged to re\ufb02ect a representative view of the sample. This was\nimportant as samples of this type can be very non-homogeneous on the grid; they\nhad the tendency not to disperse evenly and the amyloid \ufb01brils occured in distinct\n320 kHz. Typical scan settings involved the use of an applied piezo de\ufb02ection voltage\nof 0.6e0.7 V at a scan rate of 0.7 Hz. All images were processed (1st order \ufb02attening\nalgorithm) using Igor Pro software. Freshly prepared hydrogel samples were prepared\nas described above and left to settle for 2 h. A portion of each sample was then spread\nonto a clean square of silicon wafer (1 cm (cid:2) 1 cm) by gently pressing a glass coverslip\non top. Samples were then dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature for 24 h.\nSelf-assembled peptide gels with 0.1% w/v, 0.2% w/v or without CIP were prepared\ndirectly in a glass vial (diameter \u00bc 1.8 cm, height \u00bc 6.5 cm, 10 ml total volume), fol-\nlowing the procedure described above in Section 2.3 (\ufb01nal gel volume of 0.6 ml). After\n2 h, 10 ml of PBS buffer pH 7.4 were very gently added from the side of the vial,\ncarefully avoiding disruption (and subsequent \ufb02oating) of the gel disc. Vials were\nincubated at 37 (cid:4)C, 50 rpm, 70% humidity, and at selected time points 0.5 ml samples\nwere taken and replaced with 0.5 ml of fresh buffer. Samples were analysed by HPLC\nand absorbance was monitored over time. HPLC signal integration was used to\nquantify the peptide (Abs at 215 nm) and CIP (Abs at 273 nm). Fresh solutions of\npeptide and CIP were used as standards. Each experiment was repeated at least twice\nin triplicates, and mean and standard deviation values were calculated in Excel.\nConcentration of cipro\ufb02oxacin released from the gel system over a time course\nwas also determined by a modi\ufb01cation of broth micro-dilution assay from CLSI (M2-\nA8) [33]. Bacterial suspensions of S. aureus ATCC 29213, E. coli ATCC 25922,\nK. pneumoniae B5055 [34] were prepared in Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB) to reach\na density of 1 (cid:2) 106 CFU/ml. Cipro\ufb02oxacin solutions were sampled from the gel-\nreleasing vials at 4 h, 8 h, 24 h, 48 h, day 4, and day 6 and prepared as serial double\ndilutions (100 ml) in 96-well microplates with MHB. 100 ml of the bacterial suspen-\nsions were plated into microwells containing cipro\ufb02oxacin and the plates were\nincubated at 35 (cid:4)C overnight. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of cipro-\n\ufb02oxacin against of S. aureus ATCC 29213, E. coli ATCC 25922, K. pneumoniae B5055 [34]\nwere also examined using broth micro-dilution assay and commercial cipro\ufb02oxacin\npowder. This was to provide the baseline to determine the concentration of cipro-\n\ufb02oxacin in the gel solution. Concentration of cipro\ufb02oxacin ingredients released by the\ngel system at each time points were calculated, by using the formula:\n(cid:3)dilution factor. MIC was obtained as mentioned before. The\nConcentration \u00bc MIC/2\ndilution factor was obtained by counting the number of wells without visible growth.\nMicro-gel well diffusion assay was performed to examine the potential anti-\nbacterial activities of cipro\ufb02oxacin-gel system, by following the method described\nby Magaldi et al. [35] Inocula of either S. aureus ATCC 29213, E. coli ATCC 25922, or\nK. pneumoniae B5055 [34] were prepared by growing cells to a log phase (5e6 h).\nThe suspensions were adjusted with 0.85% NaCl to \ufb01nal optical density (OD) read-\nings of 0.1 and 10 with a spectrophotometer at 600 nm. These two OD readings\nrepresented bacterial cultures used for conventional antibiotic susceptibility tests\nand bacterial populations of higher resistance to antibiotics (i.e. bio\ufb01lms) respec-\ntively [36,37]. 20 ml of MuellereHinton agar were melted, cooled to 55 (cid:4)C and then\ninoculated with 1 ml of the bacterial suspension. The inoculated agar was poured\ninto the Petri dish plate, and allowed to cool down on a levelled surface. Once the\nmedium had solidi\ufb01ed, 2 wells, each of 6 mm in diameter, were cut out of the agar\nwith a biopsy puncture. 70 ml of the gel with 0.2% w/v or without cipro\ufb02oxacin were\nplaced into wells in the plate. The plates were incubated in a humid chamber for 20 h\nat 35 (cid:4)C. The plates with inhibition zone of bacterial growth were imaged.\nHaemolysis assay was performed as described by Ciornei et al. [38] Blood was\ncentrifuged at 800(cid:2) g for 10 min, and then the supernatant (plasma) and \u2018buffy coat\u2019\n(white blood cells) were removed. Erythrocytes were rinsed three times and then\nresuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Next, 400 ml of solutions\nobtained from the in vitro release study for hydrogels with 0.2% w/v cipro\ufb02oxacin at\ndifferent time points (4 h, 8 h, 24 h, 48 h, day 4, and day 6 respectively) were used to\nreplace the PBS in the erythrocyte suspension and were followed by incubation of\n2 h at 37 (cid:4)C with gentle end-over-end rotation. Triton X-100 at 2% (SigmaeAldrich)\nserved as a positive control, and DMSO at 2% served as a negative control. After\nincubation, the samples were centrifuged at 800(cid:2) g for 10 min. The release of\nhaemoglobin was monitored by measuring the absorbance of the supernatant at\n540 nm and was expressed as a percentage of the value for Triton X-100-induced\nhaemolysis.\nPeptide self-assembled hydrogels without drug were prepared as described\nabove (Section 2.3) by using 10 ml of each precursor solution which were \ufb01ltered\n(0.2 mm) and added to each microwell of a m-slide Angiogenesis uncoated (Ibidi)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"peptide_sequence\": \"lFF\", \"self-assembly_phase\": \"hydrogel\", \"N-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"C-terminal_modification\": \"Free\", \"Non-terminal_modification\": \"nan\", \"peptide_conjugate_mixture\": \"Peptide\", \"conjugate_partner\": \"nan\", \"solution\": \"100 PBS\", \"peptide_concentration(mg/ml)\": \"4.0\", \"PH\": \"7.4\", \"temperature(celsius)\": \"37.0\", \"heating_cooling\": \"No\", \"incubation_period(min)\": \"nan\"}"}]}
